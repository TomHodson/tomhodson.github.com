# Notes on how to author the files for this bit

- Create models in fusion 360 (until I get kicked out)
- create an A3 iso schematic view and export at pdf
    - A3 landscape
    - style: visible edges

- use inkscape to isolate the image and save as 500x500px svg "thumbnail.svg"
- generate a png too 

##Â Now that fusion has disabled pdf export
- export to step
- import to onshape
- create a drawing
- use the projection view to get desired iso viewpoint
- for some reason for onshape I need to remove a bunch of clips from each svg path to make it render properly
- as above
