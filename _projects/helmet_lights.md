Similar to the [bike lights](/projects/bike_lights) project, I've made a few adapters to attach lights to helmets over time. Here's the latest iteration. The light is an off the shelf model that you can slip out the side to recharge it. The two pieces fit snugly in the front air hole in the helmet.
