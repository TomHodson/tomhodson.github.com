## Soap Dispenser Tray

This was a bit of an experiment to see if I could make a kind of press mould by 3D printing it in two halves. You can see one half of the mold in the model below. Along with the soap dispensers that I was making it for.

<outline-model-viewer model = "{{page.models}}/soap_dispenser_tray/tray_2.glb" materials=keep mode=0 ambient-light="3.4" directional-light="2.4" camera = '{"position":[-3.493,4.932,-9.259],"rotation":[-2.652,-0.3214,-2.975],"zoom":223.15174865581577,"target":[0,0,0]}'>

The outcome of this was that it was a bit hard to have they clay be soft enough to deform into the mold while still having enough form to get it back out of the mold without severly deforming it. 
Some kind of mould release might have helped. 

I've been putting of trying proper slipcasting where you pour liquid clay into a plaster mold and let it set. Using the 3d printed object to make a plaster mold then using that for slip casting would likely give much better results. Next time!
