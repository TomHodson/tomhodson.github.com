- download all my runs from strava
- scatter them on a (distance, time) plot
- plot the (distance, time) curves predicted by the V02 max tables in the running book
- interpolate the table to get a smooth function parametrised by V02max
- fit that to my data

- potentially will need to take only the top 20% of runs or something
- and/or weight by time to get a better estimate of current V02max

Extensions:
- download heart rate data and make a histogram per hour of the day
- could map radius to heart rate and angle to hour of day to make a nice figure
