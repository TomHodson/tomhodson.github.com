A while ago I backed a crowdsupply project called [Sensor Watch](https://www.oddlyspecificobjects.com/products/sensorwatch/). It's a replacement logic board for those classic Casio watches that you probably don't know the name of but have certainly seen around. This post goes through the process of getting the board swapped out and programming custom firmware on it.

I also went opted for the [temperature sensor addon board](https://www.sensorwatch.net/docs/sensorboards/).

## Compiling the firmware
There is a firmware called Movement that already supports most of the things you probably want a watch to do, uses very little power and exposes a nice interface for writing extensions.
