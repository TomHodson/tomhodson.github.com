I'm Tom and I'm a PhD student in Condensed Matter Theory at Imperial College London. My research focusses on on the weird and wonderful ways that electrons behave in complex crystalline materials. For my simulations I write a lot of python and rely heavily on scipy and numpy along with the occasional cython.

In my spare time, I like to 3D print things and build electronics projects. I also recently did a poetry collaboration called [Collective Misbehaviour](https://tomhodson.github.io/PoemProject/) at Imperial.
