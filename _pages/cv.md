Work experience
-------------------
* 2018 Summer School on Collective Behaviour in Quantum Matter, ICTP, Trieste

* 2017 CERN Summer Studentship, CMS HGCAL Sensor Characterisation, CERN
  * 3 months as a CERN summer student, helping to design a high volume electronic measurement processfor prototypes of 8 inch silicon sensors that will be used in a planned upgrade to the CMS endcap Calorimeter in the LHC. My time was split between working in a clean room on the measurement setup, analysing the data and attending a 6 week lecture course on High Energy Physics.

* 2016 University of Birmingham,Atomic Force Microscopy Summer Project, Birmingham
  * Month long research placement with Professor Wolfgang Theis, designing a novel quartz tuning fork based atomic force microscope that relies on detecting resonance shifts to map out surface topographyand dissipation.

* 2012–2014 The Birmingham Makerspace, Director, Birmingham
  * FizzPOP is a community based workshop and social enterprise that fosters small technology and design projects. As one of the 5 founding directors I helped take it from a small group meeting in a borrowed space to a thriving community of more than 30 members with well equipped workshops and regular events.

* 2013 Department for International Development, Paid Hackathon, London
  * A paid hackathon for DFID as one of a team of developers. The goal was to implement novel uses and visualisations of large quantities of aid data that DFID has accrued. Our project revolved around using natural language processing to look at online conversations and decide which data was most contextually relevant to that conversation

Skills
------
* Highly proficient in the Python/Numpy/Scipy scientific stack
* Wider programming knowledge of Julia, C++/C and Javascript
* Highly mathematically literate

Service and leadership
-----------------------
* 2020–2021 Physics Departmental Postgraduate Representative, Imperial College London
  * I’m one of the two postgrad representatives for the Physics department at Imperial.
* 2019–2020 CMTH Postgraduate Representative, Imperial College London
  * Acted as the postgrad representative for my research group at Imperial.2014-2017
* Cambridge Student Community Action (SCA), President of Steering Group, Cambridge
  * President of the student steering group of the charity SCA, which runs volunteering projects for young people and the elderly in the local area. I also volunteer as a mentor to a teenager and an 11 year old meeting each once a week, helping with homework and fostering their interests.
* 2016–2017 Physics Class Representative, Cambridge
  * Responsible for liaising between my fellow students, the administration and course professors to improve the curriculum
