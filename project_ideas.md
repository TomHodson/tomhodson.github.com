# Project Ideas

## Laser Cut Projects

- Laser cut things from [here](https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2025/03/globe-gores/)

## Thermal Camera Projects

- Pair camera with iPad and fuse the 3D model generated by the iPad with thermal input.
- Use Raspberry Pi + screen + camera + thermal camera + (depth sensor?) to fuse thermals and camera input.

> - One approach requires learning iOS app development but may be more useful in the long run.
> - The other needs more hardware but could be fun for other projects too.

### Additional Ideas

- Use DeepL to segment the image input, overlay the thermal image, then do a best-fit to impute segment temperatures.
- Track motion in the camera input and overlay thermal input (copy what the iPad does). Potentially use OpenCV.
- Can the Raspberry Pi GPU be used with compute shaders yet?

## Getting Into SMD Manufacturing

- Start with a simple test board â€” maybe an ESP32 datalogger.
- Get tools.
- Decide how to heat: maybe a DIY hotplate?

### DIY Hotplate

- Already have the hotplate.
- Do I have the switches though?

## Custom Home Assistant / Smart Speaker

- Use existing Raspberry Pi.
- Add Home Assistant.
- Add air quality sensor.
- Add RGB LEDs for display.
- Add a small screen for extra metrics.
- Make a nice white case with plenty of space.
- Maybe add a microphone and try to find an open source smart speaker:

## Other Ideas

- Replace driver board on Ender 3 for quieter operation.
- Hook up PSU control with a transistor.

## Build a Linux System from Scratch

## Adjustable Bedside Lamp

- Adjustable colour temperature and brightness.
- Use high CRI LEDs and RGB LEDs.
- Power with 20V USB-C supply.
- Add microcontroller and rotary encoder.
