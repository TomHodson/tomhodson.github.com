# Interacting Quantum Many-Body Systems I have known and Loved
_Or what I've been doing for the last four years!_

__Where__: Room 711C, Floor 7, Huxley Building, Imperial College London \\
__When__: 13:30 - 14:10, December 2nd, 2022 \\
__What__:  This talk will be a gentle introduction to what I've been researching for the last four years.

__Abstract__: Large systems of interacting objects can give rise to many different emergent behaviours. Make those objects quantum and the possibilities only expand. Interacting quantum many-body systems, as such systems are called, include essentially all physical systems. Luckily, we don't usually need to consider this full quantum many-body description. The world at the human scale is essentially classical (not quantum), while at the microscopic scale of condensed matter physics we can often get by without interactions. Strongly correlated materials (SCMs), however, do require the full description. Some of the most exciting topics in modern condensed matter fall under this umbrella: the spin liquids, the fractional quantum Hall effect, high temperature superconductivity and much more.

The lecture will be hybrid in person/online. The meeting link will be added here later.
