## Credits

The layout and css for this site was *heavily* inspired by [Tim Holman's](https://tholman.com/). 

The code that generates the 3D wireframe renders on the [project pages](/projects) was written by [Omar Shehata][lines], he helpfully packaged the code up so others could ~~steal~~ use it [here][lines_github].
