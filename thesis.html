<h1 class="thesis-title">Interacting quantum many body systems I have known and loved</h1>
<p>This thesis summarises the work I did for my PhD between 2018 and 2022. I defended it in December 2022 and submitted the corrections in January 2023.

<p>The formal abstract follows but, in a paragraph, it's about what happens when many electrons interact together in a way where their 'quantumness' is important. It turns out that many weird and wonderful things can happen. Alas we, quantum physicists, don't have great mathematical tools to describe these things. Trying to fix that is what this thesis is about.
