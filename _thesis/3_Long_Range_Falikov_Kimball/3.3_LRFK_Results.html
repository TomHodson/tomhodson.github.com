<h2>Phase Diagram</h2>
<p>Using the MCMC methods described in the previous section I will now discuss the results of extensive MCMC simulations of the model, starting with the phase diagram in the fermion spin coupling <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, the strength of the long range spin-spin coupling <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>Fig fig. <a href="#fig:phase_diagram">1</a> shows the phase diagram for constant <span class="math inline">\(U=5\)</span> and constant <span class="math inline">\(J=5\)</span>, respectively. The transition temperatures were determined from the crossings of the Binder cumulants <span class="math inline">\(B_4 = \langle m^4 \rangle /\langle m^2 \rangle^2\)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="binderFiniteSizeScaling1981"> [<a href="#ref-binderFiniteSizeScaling1981" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. For a representative set of parameters, fig. <strong>¿fig:binder_cumulants?</strong> shows the order parameter <span class="math inline">\(\langle m \rangle^2\)</span> and the Binder cumulants, both as functions of system size and temperature. The crossings confirm that the system has a FTPT and that the ordered phase is not a finite size effect.</p>
<p>The CDW transition temperature is largely independent from the strength of the interaction <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. This demonstrates that the phase transition is driven by the long-range term <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> with little effect from the coupling to the fermions <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. The physics of the spin sector in the long-range FK model mimics that of the long range Ising (LRI) model and is not significantly altered by the presence of the fermions. In two dimensions the transition to the CDW phase is mediated by an RKYY-like interaction <span class="citation" data-cites="rusinCalculationRKKYRange2017"> [<a href="#ref-rusinCalculationRKKYRange2017" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> but this is insufficient to stabilise long range order in one dimension. That the critical temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span> does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> in our model further confirms this.</p>
<p>The main order parameters for this model is the staggered magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(m = N^{-1} \sum_i (-1)^i S_i\)</span> that signals the onset of a charge density wave (CDW) phase at low temperature. However, my main interest concerns the additional structure of the fermionic sector in the high temperature phase. Following Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="antipovInteractionTunedAndersonMott2016"> [<a href="#ref-antipovInteractionTunedAndersonMott2016" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>, we can distinguish between the Mott and Anderson insulating phases. The Mott insulator is characterised by a gapped DOS in the absence of a CDW, instead the gap is driven entirely by interaction effect. Thus, the opening of a gap for large <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is distinct from the gap-opening induced by the translational symmetry breaking in the CDW state below <span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>, see also fig. <strong>¿fig:gap_opening?</strong>. The Anderson phase is gapless but, as we explain below, shows localised fermionic eigenstates hence it also has insulating character.</p>

<p>The MCMC formulation suggests viewing the spin configurations as a form of annealed binary disorder whose probability distribution is given by the Boltzmann weight <span class="math inline">\(e^{-\beta H_S[\vec{S}] - \beta F_c[\vec{S}]}\)</span>. This makes apparent the link to the study of disordered systems and Anderson localisation. While these systems are typically studied by defining the probability distribution for the quenched disorder potential externally, here we have a translation invariant system with disorder as a natural consequence of the Ising background field conserved under the dynamics.</p>
<p>In the limits of zero and infinite temperature, our model becomes a simple tight-binding model for the fermions. At zero temperature, the spin background is in one of the two translation invariant AFM ground states with two gapped fermionic CDW bands at energies <span class="math display">\[E_{\pm} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}U^2 + 2t^2(1 + \cos ka)^2}\;.\]</span></p>
<p>At infinite temperature, all the spin configurations become equally likely and the fermionic model reduces to one of binary uncorrelated disorder in which all eigenstates are Anderson localised <span class="citation" data-cites="abrahamsScalingTheoryLocalization1979"> [<a href="#ref-abrahamsScalingTheoryLocalization1979" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. An Anderson localised state centered around <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> has magnitude that drops exponentially over some localisation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> i.e <span class="math inline">\(|\psi(r)|^2 \sim \exp{-|r - r_0|/\xi}\)</span>. Calculating <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> directly is numerically demanding. Therefore, we determine if a given state is localised via the energy-resolved IPR and the DOS defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{DOS}(\vec{S}, \omega)&amp; = N^{-1} \sum_{i} \delta(\epsilon_i - \omega)\\
\mathrm{IPR}(\vec{S}, \omega)&amp; = \; N^{-1} \mathrm{DOS}(\vec{S}, \omega)^{-1} \sum_{i,j} \delta(\epsilon_i - \omega)\;\psi^{4}_{i,j}\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{i,j}\)</span> are the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th energy level and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>th element of the corresponding eigenfunction, both dependent on the background spin configuration <span class="math inline">\(\vec{S}\)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The scaling of the IPR with system size</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{IPR} \propto N^{-\tau}\]</span></p>
<p>depends on the localisation properties of states at that energy. For delocalised states, e.g. Bloch waves, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the physical dimension. For fully localised states <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit. However, for special types of disorder such as binary disorder, the localisation lengths can be large comparable to the system size at hand, which can make it difficult to extract the correct scaling. An additional complication arises from the fact that the scaling exponent may display intermediate behaviours for correlated disorder and in the vicinity of a localisation-delocalisation transition <span class="citation" data-cites="kramerLocalizationTheoryExperiment1993 eversAndersonTransitions2008"> [<a href="#ref-kramerLocalizationTheoryExperiment1993" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>,<a href="#ref-eversAndersonTransitions2008" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. The thermal defects of the CDW phase lead to a binary disorder potential with a finite correlation length, which in principle could result in delocalized eigenstates.</p>
<p>The key question for our system is then: How is the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> CDW phase with fully delocalized fermionic states connected to the fully localized phase at high temperatures?</p>
<p>For a representative set of parameters covering all three phases fig. <a href="#fig:DOS">2</a> shows the density of states as function of energy while fig. <a href="#fig:IPR_scaling">3</a> shows <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the scaling exponent of the IPR with system size, The DOS is symmetric about <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> because of the particle hole symmetry of the model. At high temperatures, all of the eigenstates are localised in both the Mott and Anderson phases (with <span class="math inline">\(\tau \leq 0.07\)</span> for our system sizes). We also checked that the states are localised by direct inspection. Note that there are in-gap states for instance at <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0\)</span>, below the upper band which are localized and smoothly connected across the phase transition.</p>

<p>In the CDW phases at <span class="math inline">\(U=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U=5\)</span>, we find for the states within the gapped CDW bands, e.g. at <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span>, scaling exponents <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 0.30\pm0.03\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau = 0.15\pm0.05\)</span>, respectively. This surprising finding suggests that the CDW bands are partially delocalised with multi-fractal behaviour of the wavefunctions <span class="citation" data-cites="eversAndersonTransitions2008"> [<a href="#ref-eversAndersonTransitions2008" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. This phenomenon would be unexpected in a 1D model as they generally do not support delocalisation in the presence of disorder except as the result of correlations in the emergent disorder potential <span class="citation" data-cites="croyAndersonLocalization1D2011 goldshteinPurePointSpectrum1977"> [<a href="#ref-croyAndersonLocalization1D2011" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="#ref-goldshteinPurePointSpectrum1977" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. However, we later show by comparison to an uncorrelated Anderson model that these nonzero exponents are a finite size effect and the states are localised with a finite <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> similar to the system size, an example of weak localisation. As a result, the IPR does not scale correctly until the system size has grown much larger than <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>. fig. <a href="#fig:DM_IPR_scaling">7</a> shows that the scaling of the IPR in the CDW phase does flatten out eventually.</p>
<p>Next, we use the DOS and the scaling exponent <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> to explore the localisation properties over the energy-temperature plane in fig. <strong>¿fig:gap_opening?</strong>. Gapped areas are shown in white, which highlights the distinction between the gapped Mott phase and the ungapped Anderson phase. In-gap states appear just below the critical point, smoothly filling the bandgap in the Anderson phase and forming islands in the Mott phase. As in the finite <span class="citation" data-cites="zondaGaplessRegimeCharge2019"> [<a href="#ref-zondaGaplessRegimeCharge2019" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span> and infinite dimensional <span class="citation" data-cites="hassanSpectralPropertiesChargedensitywave2007"> [<a href="#ref-hassanSpectralPropertiesChargedensitywave2007" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span> cases, the in-gap states merge and are pushed to lower energy for decreasing U as the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> CDW gap closes. Intuitively, the presence of in-gap states can be understood as a result of domain wall fluctuations away from the AFM ordered background. These domain walls act as local potentials for impurity-like bound states <span class="citation" data-cites="zondaGaplessRegimeCharge2019"> [<a href="#ref-zondaGaplessRegimeCharge2019" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>In order to understand the localization properties we can compare the behaviour of our model with that of a simpler Anderson disorder model (DM) in which the spins are replaced by a CDW background with uncorrelated binary defect potentials. This is defined by replacing the spin degree of freedom in the FK model <span class="math inline">\(S_i = \pm \tfrac{1}{2}\)</span> with a disorder potential <span class="math inline">\(d_i = \pm \tfrac{1}{2}\)</span> controlled by a defect density <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(d_i = -\tfrac{1}{2}\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(\rho/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_i = \tfrac{1}{2}\)</span> otherwise. <span class="math inline">\(\rho/2\)</span> is used rather than <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> so that the disorder potential takes on the zero temperature CDW ground state at <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span> and becomes a random choice over spin states at <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 1\)</span> i.e the infinite temperature limit.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H_{\mathrm{DM}} = &amp; \;U \sum_{i} (-1)^i \; d_i \;(c^\dagger_{i}c_{i} - \tfrac{1}{2}) \\

<p>As we can sample directly from the disorder model, rather than through MCMC, the samples are uncorrelated. Hence we can evaluate much larger system sizes with the disorder model which enables us to pin down the correct localisation effects. In particular, what appear to be delocalized states for small system sizes eventually turn out to be states with large localization length. The localization length diverges towards the ordered zero temperature CDW state. The interplay of interactions, which here produce as peculiar binary potential, and localization can be very intricate and the added advantage of a 1D model is that we can explore very large system sizes.</p>

<h1>Discussion and Conclusion</h1>
<p>The FK model is one of the simplest non-trivial models of interacting fermions. We studied its thermodynamic and localisation properties brought down in dimensionality to 1D by adding a novel long-ranged coupling designed to stabilise the CDW phase present in dimension two and above. Our hybrid MCMC approach elucidates a disorder-free localization mechanism within our translationally invariant system. Further, we demonstrate a significant speedup over the naive method. We show that our long-range FK in 1D retains much of the rich phase diagram of its higher dimensional cousins. Careful scaling analysis indicates that all the single particle eigenstates eventually localise at nonzero temperature albeit only for very large system sizes of several thousand.</p>
<p>Our work raises a number of interesting questions for future research. A straightforward but numerically challenging problem is to pin down the model’s behaviour closer to the critical point where correlations in the spin sector would become significant. Would this modify the localisation behaviour? Similar to other soluble models of disorder-free localisation, we expect intriguing out-of equilibrium physics, for example slow entanglement dynamics akin to more generic interacting systems <span class="citation" data-cites="hartLogarithmicEntanglementGrowth2020"> [<a href="#ref-hartLogarithmicEntanglementGrowth2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. One could also investigate whether the rich ground state phenomenology of the FK model as a function of filling <span class="citation" data-cites="gruberGroundStatesSpinless1990"> [<a href="#ref-gruberGroundStatesSpinless1990" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span> such as the devil’s staircase <span class="citation" data-cites="michelettiCompleteDevilTextquotesingles1997"> [<a href="#ref-michelettiCompleteDevilTextquotesingles1997" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> could be stabilised at finite temperature. In a broader context, we envisage that long-range interactions can also be used to gain a deeper understanding of the temperature evolution of topological phases. One example would be a long-ranged FK version of the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model where one could explore the interplay of topological bound states and thermal domain wall defects. Finally, the rich physics of our model should be realizable in systems with long-range interactions, such as trapped ion quantum simulators, where one can also explore the fully interacting regime with a dynamical background field.</p>
