<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a useful method whenever we have a
probability distribution that we want to sample from but there is not
direct sampling way to do so.</p>
<p>In almost any computer simulation the ultimate source of randomness
is a stream of (close to) uniform, uncorrelated bits generated from a
pseudo random number generator. A direct sampling method takes such a
source and outputs uncorrelated samples from the target distribution.
The fact they’re uncorrelated is key as we’ll see later. Examples of
direct sampling methods range from the trivial: take n random bits to
generate integers uniformly between 0 and <span
class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> to more complex methods such as
inverse transform sampling and rejection sampling<span class="citation"
data-cites="devroyeRandomSampling1986"><sup><a
href="#ref-devroyeRandomSampling1986"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>In physics the distribution we usually want to sample from is the
Boltzmann probability over states of the system <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
p(S)  &amp;= \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}} e^{-\beta H(S)} \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z} = \sum_S
e^{-\beta H(S)}\)</span> is the normalisation factor and ubiquitous
partition function. In principle we could directly sample from this, for
a discrete system there are finitely many choices. We could calculate
the probability of each one and assign each a region of the unit
interval which we could then sample uniformly from.</p>
<p>However if we actually try to do this we will run into two problems,
we can’t calculate <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> for
any reasonably sized systems because the state space grows exponentially
with system size. Even if we could calculate <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span>, sampling from an
exponentially large number of options quickly become tricky. This kind
of problem happens in many other disciplines too, particularly when
fitting statistical models using Bayesian inference<span
class="citation" data-cites="BMCP2021"><sup><a href="#ref-BMCP2021"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span>.</p>
<h2 id="markov-chains">Markov Chains</h2>
<p>So what can we do? Well it turns out that if we’re willing to give up
in the requirement that the samples be uncorrelated then we can use MCMC
instead.</p>
<p>MCMC defines a weighted random walk over the states <span
class="math inline">\((S_0, S_1, S_2, ...)\)</span>, such that in the
long time limit, states are visited according to their probability <span
class="math inline">\(p(S)\)</span>.<span class="citation"
data-cites="binderGuidePracticalWork1988 kerteszAdvancesComputerSimulation1998 wolffMonteCarloErrors2004"><sup><a
href="#ref-binderGuidePracticalWork1988" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>–<a
href="#ref-wolffMonteCarloErrors2004"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>In a physics context this lets us evaluate any observable with a mean
over the states visited by the walk. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\langle O \rangle &amp; = \sum_{S} p(S) \langle O \rangle_{S} = \sum_{i
= 0}^{M} \expval{O}_{S_i} + \mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{M}})\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The choice of the transition function for MCMC is under-determined as
one only needs to satisfy a set of balance conditions for which there
are many solutions <span class="citation"
data-cites="kellyReversibilityStochasticNetworks1981"><sup><a

<h2 id="application-to-the-fk-model">Application to the FK Model</h2>
<p>We will work in the grand canonical ensemble of fixed temperature,
chemical potential and volume.</p>
<p>Since the spin configurations are classical, the Hamiltonian can be
split into a classical spin part <span
class="math inline">\(H_s\)</span> and an operator valued part <span
class="math inline">\(H_c\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H_s&amp; = - \frac{U}{2}S_i + \sum_{i, j}^{N} J_{ij} S_i S_j \\
H_c&amp; = \sum_i U S_i c^\dagger_{i}c_{i} -t(c^\dagger_{i}c_{i+1} +
c^\dagger_{i+1}c_{i})
\end{aligned}\]</span> The partition function can then be written as a
sum over spin configurations, <span class="math inline">\(\vec{S} =
(S_0, S_1...S_{N-1})\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{Z} = \mathrm{Tr} e^{-\beta H}= \sum_{\vec{S}} e^{-\beta H_s}
\mathrm{Tr}_c e^{-\beta H_c} .
\end{aligned}
\]</span> The contribution of <span class="math inline">\(H_c\)</span>
to the grand canonical partition function can be obtained by performing
the sum over eigenstate occupation numbers giving <span
class="math inline">\(-\beta F_c[\vec{S}] = \sum_k \ln{(1 + e^{- \beta
\epsilon_k})}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\({\epsilon_k[\vec{S}]}\)</span> are the eigenvalues
of the matrix representation of <span class="math inline">\(H_c\)</span>
determined through exact diagonalisation. This gives a partition
function containing a classical energy which corresponds to the
long-range interaction of the spins, and a free energy which corresponds
to the quantum subsystem. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{Z} = \sum_{\vec{S}} e^{-\beta H_S[\vec{S}] - \beta
F_c[\vec{S}]} = \sum_{\vec{S}} e^{-\beta E[\vec{S}]}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="markov-chain-monte-carlo-1">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</h3>
<p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a technique for evaluating thermal
expectation values <span class="math inline">\(\expval{O}\)</span> with
respect to some physical system defined by a set of states <span
class="math inline">\(\{x: x \in S\}\)</span> and a free energy <span
class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1998"><sup><a
href="#ref-krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1998"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. The thermal expectation value
is defined via a Boltzmann weighted sum over the entire states: <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
    \expval{O} &amp;= \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}} \sum_{x \in S} O(x) P(x) \\
    P(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\mathcal{Z}} e^{-\beta F(x)} \\
    \mathcal{Z} &amp;= \sum_{x \in S} e^{-\beta F(x)}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>When the state space is too large to evaluate this sum directly, MCMC
defines a stochastic algorithm which generates a random walk <span
class="math inline">\(\{x_0\ldots x_i\ldots x_N\}\)</span> whose
distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(x_i)\)</span> approaches a
target distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> in the
large N limit.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lim_{i\to\infty} p(x_i) =
P(x)\]</span></p>
<p>In this case the target distribution will be the thermal one <span
class="math inline">\(P(x) \rightarrow \mathcal{Z}^{-1} e^{-\beta
F(x)}\)</span>. The major benefit of the method being that as long as
one can express the desired <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> up
to a multiplicative constant, MCMC can be applied. Since <span
class="math inline">\(e^{-\beta F(x)}\)</span> is relatively easy to
evaluate, MCMC provides a useful method for finite temperature
physics.</p>
<p>Once the random walk has been carried out for many steps, the
expectation values of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> can be
estimated from the MCMC samples: <span class="math display">\[
    \expval{O} = \sum_{i = 0}^{N} O(x_i) +
\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})
\]</span> The the samples in the random walk are correlated so the
samples effectively contain less information than <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> independent samples would. As a
consequence the variance is larger than the <span
class="math inline">\(\expval{O^2} - \expval{O}^2\)</span> form it would
have if the estimates were uncorrelated. Methods of estimating the true
variance of <span class="math inline">\(\expval{O}\)</span> and decided
how many steps are needed will be considered later.</p>
<h2 id="the-metropolis-hasting-algorithm">The Metropolis-Hasting
Algorithm</h2>
<p>Markov chains are defined by a transition function $(x_{i+1} x_i) $
giving the probability that a chain in state <span
class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> at time <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will transition to a state <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i+1}\)</span>. Since we must transition
somewhere at each step, this comes with the normalisation condition that
<span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_x \mathcal{T}(x&#39; \rightarrow
x) = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we define an ensemble of Markov chains and consider the
distributions we get a sequence of distributions <span
class="math inline">\(\{p_0(x), p_1(x), p_2(x)\ldots\}\)</span> with
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
p_{i+1}(x) &amp;= \sum_{x&#39; \in S} p_i(x&#39;) \mathcal{T}(x&#39;
\rightarrow x)
\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(p_o(x)\)</span> might
be a delta function on one particular starting state which would then be
smoothed out by the transition function repeatedly.</p>
<p>As we’d like to draw samples from the target distribution <span
class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> the trick is to choose $(x_{i+1}

<p>A sufficient but not necessary condition for global balance to hold

thermal distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> as its
fixed point and that it converges quickly onto it. This boils down to

eigenvector equal to <span class="math inline">\(P_i = P(x_i)\)</span>

<h2 id="proposal-distributions">Proposal Distributions</h2>
<p>In a MCMC method a key property is the proportion of the time that
proposals are accepted, the acceptance rate. If this rate is too low the
random walk is trying to take overly large steps in energy space which
problematic because it means very few new samples will be generated. If
it is too high it implies the steps are too small, a problem because
then the walk will take longer to explore the state space and the
samples will be highly correlated. Ideal values for the acceptance rate
can be calculated under certain assumptions<span class="citation"
data-cites="robertsWeakConvergenceOptimal1997"><sup><a

rate and if it is too high we re-run the MCMC with a modified proposal
distribution that has a chance to propose moves that flip multiple sites
at a time.</p>
<p>In addition we exploit the particle-hole symmetry of the problem by
occasionally proposing a flip of the entire state. This works because
near half-filling, flipping the occupations of all the sites will
produce a state at or near the energy of the current one.</p>

replaced by equivalent traces. The obvious approach to evaluate these
sums numerically would be to directly loop over all the classical states
in the system and perform the sum. But we all know know why this isn’t
feasible: the state space is too large! Indeed even if we could do it,
it would still be computationally wasteful since at low temperatures the
sums are dominated by low energy excitations about the ground states of
the system. Even worse, in our case we must fully solve the fermionic
system via exact diagonalisation for each classical state in the sum, a
very expensive operation!~\footnote{The effort involved in exact
diagonalisation scales like <span class="math inline">\(N^2\)</span> for

<p>MCMC sidesteps these issues by defining a random walk that focuses on
the states with the greatest Boltzmann weight. At low temperatures this
means we need only visit a few low energy states to make good estimates
while at high temperatures the weights become uniform so a small number
of samples distributed across the state space suffice. However we will
see that the method is not without difficulties of its own.</p>
<p>%MCMC from an ensemble point of view In implementation can be boiled
down to choosing a transition function $(_{t} _t+1) $ where <span
class="math inline">\(\s\)</span> are vectors representing classical
spin configurations. We start in some initial state <span
class="math inline">\(\s_0\)</span> and then repeatedly jump to new
states according to the probabilities given by <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>. This defines a set of random
walks <span class="math inline">\(\{\s_0\ldots \s_i\ldots
\s_N\}\)</span>. Fig.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:single}\)</span> shows this in practice:
we have a (rather small) ensemble of <span class="math inline">\(M =
2\)</span> walkers starting at the same point in state space and then
spreading outwards by flipping spins along the way.</p>
<p>In pseudo-code one could write the MCMC simulation for a single
walker as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>current_state <span class="op">=</span> initial_state</span>

<p>Where the <code>sample_T</code> function here produces a state with
probability determined by the <code>current_state</code> and the
transition function <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we ran many such walkers in parallel we could then approximate the
distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_t(\s; \s_0)\)</span> which
tells us where the walkers are likely to be after they’ve evolved for
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> steps from an initial state <span
class="math inline">\(\s_0\)</span>. We need to carefully choose <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> such that after a large
number of steps <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (the convergence
time) the probability <span class="math inline">\(p_t(\s;\s_0)\)</span>
approaches the thermal distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(\s;
\beta) = \mathcal{Z}^{-1} e^{-\beta F(\s)}\)</span>. This turns out to
be quite easy to achieve using the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="convergence-time">Convergence Time</h3>
<p>Considering <span class="math inline">\(p(\s)\)</span> as a vector
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}\)</span> whose jth entry is the
probability of the jth state <span class="math inline">\(p_j =
p(\s_j)\)</span>, and writing <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> as the matrix with entries
<span class="math inline">\(T_{ij} = \mathcal{T}(\s_j \rightarrow
\s_i)\)</span> we can write the update rule for the ensemble probability
as: <span class="math display">\[\vec{p}_{t+1} = \mathcal{T} \vec{p}_t
\implies \vec{p}_{t} = \mathcal{T}^t \vec{p}_0\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{p}_0\)</span> is vector which is one on the
starting state and zero everywhere else. Since all states must
transition to somewhere with probability one: <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_i T_{ij} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Matrices that satisfy this are called stochastic matrices exactly
because they model these kinds of Markov processes. It can be shown that
they have real eigenvalues, and ordering them by magnitude, that <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_0 = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \lambda_{i\neq0} &lt; 1\)</span>.
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix</p>
<p>Assuming <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> has been
chosen correctly, its single eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 will be the
thermal distribution so repeated application of the transition function
eventually leads there, while memory of the initial conditions decays
exponentially with a convergence time <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> determined by <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span>. In practice this means that
one throws away the data from the beginning of the random walk in order
reduce the dependence on the initial conditions and be close enough to
the target distribution.</p>

<p>At this stage one might think we’re done. We can indeed draw
independent samples from <span class="math inline">\(P(\s;
\beta)\)</span> by starting from some arbitrary initial state and doing
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps to arrive at a sample.
However a key insight is that after the convergence time, every state
generated is a sample from <span class="math inline">\(P(\s;
\beta)\)</span>! They are not, however, independent samples. In
Fig.~<span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:raw}\)</span> it is already
clear that the samples of the order parameter m have some
auto-correlation because only a few spins are flipped each step but even
when the number of spins flipped per step is increased, Fig.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:m_autocorr}\)</span> shows that it can be
an important effect near the phase transition. Let’s define the
auto-correlation time <span class="math inline">\(\tau(O)\)</span>
informally as the number of MCMC samples of some observable O that are
statistically equal to one independent sample or equivalently as the
number of MCMC steps after which the samples are correlated below some
cutoff, see<span class="citation"
data-cites="krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1996"><sup><a
href="#ref-krauthIntroductionMonteCarlo1996"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> for a more rigorous definition
involving a sum over the auto-correlation function. The auto-correlation
time is generally shorter than the convergence time so it therefore
makes sense from an efficiency standpoint to run a single walker for
many MCMC steps rather than to run a huge ensemble for <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps each.</p>
<p>Once the random walk has been carried out for many steps, the
expectation values of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> can be
estimated from the MCMC samples <span
class="math inline">\(\s_i\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
    \tex{O} = \sum_{i = 0}^{N} O(\s_i) + \mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})
\]</span> The the samples are correlated so the N of them effectively
contains less information than <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
independent samples would, in fact roughly <span
class="math inline">\(N/\tau\)</span> effective samples. As a
consequence the variance is larger than the <span
class="math inline">\(\qex{O^2} - \qex{O}^2\)</span> form it would have
if the estimates were uncorrelated. There are many methods in the
literature for estimating the true variance of <span
class="math inline">\(\qex{O}\)</span> and deciding how many steps are
needed but my approach has been to run a small number of parallel
chains, which are independent, in order to estimate the statistical
error produced. This is a slightly less computationally efficient
because it requires throwing away those <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps generated before convergence
multiple times but it is a conceptually simple workaround.</p>
<p>In summary, to do efficient simulations we want to reduce both the
convergence time and the auto-correlation time as much as possible. In
order to explain how, we need to introduce the Metropolis-Hasting (MH)
algorithm and how it gives an explicit form for the transition
function.</p>
<h3 id="the-metropolis-hastings-algorithm">The Metropolis-Hastings

<p>MH breaks up the transition function into a proposal distribution
<span class="math inline">\(q(\s \to \s&#39;)\)</span> and an acceptance
function <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}(\s \to
\s&#39;)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> needs to be
something that we can directly sample from, and in our case generally
takes the form of flipping some number of spins in <span
class="math inline">\(\s\)</span>, i.e if we’re flipping a single random
spin in the spin chain, <span class="math inline">\(q(\s \to

<p>Here, we incorporate a modification to the standard
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <span class="citation"

data-cites="hodsonMCMCFKModel2021"><sup><a
href="#ref-hodsonMCMCFKModel2021"
role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span> we employ a modification of the
algorithm which is based on the observation that the free energy of the
FK system is composed of a classical part which is much quicker to
compute than the quantum part. Hence, we can obtain a computational
speedup by first considering the value of the classical energy
difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_s\)</span> and rejecting
the transition if the former is too high. We only compute the quantum
energy difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta F_c\)</span> if the
transition is accepted. We then perform a second rejection sampling step
based upon it. This corresponds to two nested comparisons with the
majority of the work only occurring if the first test passes and has the
acceptance function <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{A}(a \to b) =
\min\left(1, e^{-\beta \Delta H_s}\right)\min\left(1, e^{-\beta \Delta
F_c}\right)\;.\]</span></p>
<p>For the model parameters used in Fig. <a href="#fig:indiv_IPR"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:indiv_IPR">2</a>, we find
that with our new scheme the matrix diagonalisation is skipped around
30% of the time at <span class="math inline">\(T = 2.5\)</span> and up
to 80% at <span class="math inline">\(T = 1.5\)</span>. We observe that
for <span class="math inline">\(N = 50\)</span>, the matrix
diagonalisation, if it occurs, occupies around 60% of the total
computation time for a single step. This rises to 90% at N = 300 and
further increases for larger N. We therefore get the greatest speedup
for large system sizes at low temperature where many prospective
transitions are rejected at the classical stage and the matrix
computation takes up the greatest fraction of the total computation
time. The upshot is that we find a speedup of up to a factor of 10 at
the cost of very little extra algorithmic complexity.</p>
<p>Our two-step method should be distinguished from the more common
method for speeding up MCMC which is to add asymmetry to the proposal
distribution to make it as similar as possible to <span
class="math inline">\(\min\left(1, e^{-\beta \Delta E}\right)\)</span>.
This reduces the number of rejected states, which brings the algorithm
closer in efficiency to a direct sampling method. However it comes at
the expense of requiring a way to directly sample from this complex
distribution, a problem which MCMC was employed to solve in the first
place. For example, recent work trains restricted Boltzmann machines
(RBMs) to generate samples for the proposal distribution of the FK
model <span class="citation"
data-cites="huangAcceleratedMonteCarlo2017"><sup><a
href="#ref-huangAcceleratedMonteCarlo2017"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. The RBMs are chosen as a
parametrisation of the proposal distribution that can be efficiently
sampled from while offering sufficient flexibility that they can be
adjusted to match the target distribution. Our proposed method is
considerably simpler and does not require training while still reaping
some of the benefits of reduced computation.</p>

<p>Now we can discuss how to minimise the auto-correlations. The general
principle is that one must balance the proposal distribution between two
extremes. Choose overlay small steps, like flipping only a single spin
and the acceptance rate will be high because <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta F\)</span> will usually be small, but each
state will be very similar to the previous and the auto-correlations
will be high too, making sampling inefficient. On the other hand,
overlay large steps, like randomising a large portion of the spins each
step, will result in very frequent rejections, especially at low
temperatures.</p>
<p>I evaluated a few different proposal distributions for use with the
FK model.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flipping a single random site</li>
<li>Flipping N random sites for some N</li>
<li>Choosing n from Uniform(1, N) and then flipping n sites for some
fixed N.</li>
<li>Attempting to tune the proposal distribution for each parameter
regime.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fro Figure~<span class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:comparison}\)</span>
we see that even at moderately high temperatures <span
class="math inline">\(T &gt; T_c\)</span> flipping one or two sites is
the best choice. However for some simulations at very high temperature
flipping more spins is warranted. Tuning the proposal distribution
automatically seems like something that would not yield enough benefit
for the additional complexity it would require.</p>

<p>While there are many problems with high dimensions, my favourite
being that there are no stable gravitational orbits in 4D and above, the
specific issue we’ll focus on here is that it’s very hard to compute
integrals over high dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>The standard methods for numerical integration in 1,2 and 3
dimensions mostly work in the same way REFERENCE. You evaluate the
integrand at a grid of points, define an interpolating function over the
points that’s easy to integrate and then integrate the function. For a
fixed grid spacing <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> on a finite
domain of integration we’ll find that we need to evaluate <span
class="math inline">\(\propto (1/d)^D\)</span> points, which scales
exponentially with dimension!</p>
<p>In statistical physics the main integral that one would love to be
able to evaluate is of course the partition function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z = \int ds e^{-\beta F}\]</span></p>
<p>And as this is condensed matter theory, we will mainly be looking at
quantum models in which our states are discrete occupation numbers of
single particle energy states. For a spin model with just two states per
site and N sites we therefore end up with <span
class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> possible states of the system.</p>

the fact that statistical physics can be somewhat boring in one

chapter is motivated by the the converse problem, high dimensional
spaces can sometimes be just too much.</p>
<p>While there are many problems with high dimensions <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
it’s very hard to compute integrals over high dimensional spaces. If we
take a discrete space with <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
dimensions each taking <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> distinct
values.</p>
<p>For a classical system, the thermal expectation value of some
operator <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is defined by a
Boltzmann weighted sum over the classical state space: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \tex{O} &amp;= \frac{1}{\Z} \sum_{\s \in S} O(x) P(x) \\
    P(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\Z} e^{-\beta F(x)} \\
    \Z &amp;= \sum_{\s \in S} e^{-\beta F(x)}\end{aligned}\]</span>
While for a quantum system these sums are replaced by equivalent traces.
The obvious approach to evaluate these sums numerically would be to
directly loop over all the classical states in the system and perform
the sum. But we all know know why this isn’t feasible: the state space
is too large! Indeed even if we could do it, it would still be
computationally wasteful since at low temperatures the sums are
dominated by low energy excitations about the ground states of the
system. Even worse, in our case we must fully solve the fermionic system
via exact diagonalisation for each classical state in the sum, a very
expensive operation! <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

<span class="math inline">\(\{\s_0\ldots \s_i\ldots \s_N\}\)</span>.
Fig. <a href="#fig:single" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:single">2</a> shows this in practice: we have a
(rather small) ensemble of <span class="math inline">\(M = 2\)</span>
walkers starting at the same point in state space and then spreading
outwards by flipping spins along the way.</p>
<p>In pseudo-code one could write the MCMC simulation for a single
walker as:</p>
<div class="markdown">
<p>“’python current_state = initial_state</p>
<p>for i in range(N_steps): new_state = sample_T(current_state)
states[i] = current_state “’</p>
</div>
<p>Where the <code>sample_T</code> function here produces a state with
probability determined by the <code>current_state</code> and the
transition function <span class="math inline">\(\T\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we ran many such walkers in parallel we could then approximate the
distribution <span class="math inline">\(p_t(\s; \s_0)\)</span> which
tells us where the walkers are likely to be after they’ve evolved for
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> steps from an initial state <span
class="math inline">\(\s_0\)</span>. We need to carefully choose <span
class="math inline">\(\T\)</span> such that after a large number of
steps <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (the convergence time) the
probability <span class="math inline">\(p_t(\s;\s_0)\)</span> approaches
the thermal distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(\s; \beta) =
\Z^{-1} e^{-\beta F(\s)}\)</span>. This turns out to be quite easy to
achieve using the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="convergence-time-1">Convergence Time</h2>
<p>Considering <span class="math inline">\(p(\s)\)</span> as a vector
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{p}\)</span> whose jth entry is the
probability of the jth state <span class="math inline">\(p_j =
p(\s_j)\)</span>, and writing <span class="math inline">\(\T\)</span> as
the matrix with entries <span class="math inline">\(T_{ij} = \T(\s_j
\rightarrow \s_i)\)</span> we can write the update rule for the ensemble
probability as: <span class="math display">\[\vec{p}_{t+1} = \T
\vec{p}_t \implies \vec{p}_{t} = \T^t \vec{p}_0\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{p}_0\)</span> is vector which is one on the
starting state and zero everywhere else. Since all states must
transition to somewhere with probability one: <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_i T_{ij} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Matrices that satisfy this are called stochastic matrices exactly
because they model these kinds of Markov processes. It can be shown that
they have real eigenvalues, and ordering them by magnitude, that <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_0 = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \lambda_{i\neq0} &lt; 1\)</span>. Assuming
<span class="math inline">\(\T\)</span> has been chosen correctly, its
single eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 will be the thermal distribution <a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> so repeated application of the
transition function eventually leads there, while memory of the initial
conditions decays exponentially with a convergence time <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> determined by <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span>. In practice this means that
one throws away the data from the beginning of the random walk in order
reduce the dependence on the initial conditions and be close enough to
the target distribution.</p>

<p>At this stage one might think we’re done. We can indeed draw
independent samples from <span class="math inline">\(P(\s;
\beta)\)</span> by starting from some arbitrary initial state and doing
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps to arrive at a sample.
However a key insight is that after the convergence time, every state
generated is a sample from <span class="math inline">\(P(\s;
\beta)\)</span>! They are not, however, independent samples. In Fig. <a
href="#fig:raw" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:raw">1</a>
it is already clear that the samples of the order parameter m have some
auto-correlation because only a few spins are flipped each step but even
when the number of spins flipped per step is increased, Fig. <a
href="#fig:m_autocorr" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:m_autocorr">3</a> shows that it can be an important
effect near the phase transition. Let’s define the auto-correlation time
<span class="math inline">\(\tau(O)\)</span> informally as the number of
MCMC samples of some observable O that are statistically equal to one
independent sample. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The auto-correlation time is
generally shorter than the convergence time so it therefore makes sense
from an efficiency standpoint to run a single walker for many MCMC steps
rather than to run a huge ensemble for <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps each.</p>
<p>Once the random walk has been carried out for many steps, the
expectation values of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> can be
estimated from the MCMC samples <span
class="math inline">\(\s_i\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\tex{O} = \sum_{i = 0}^{N} O(\s_i) +
\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})\]</span> The the samples are correlated
so the N of them effectively contains less information than <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> independent samples would, in fact
roughly <span class="math inline">\(N/\tau\)</span> effective samples.
As a consequence the variance is larger than the <span
class="math inline">\(\qex{O^2} - \qex{O}^2\)</span> form it would have
if the estimates were uncorrelated. There are many methods in the
literature for estimating the true variance of <span
class="math inline">\(\qex{O}\)</span> and deciding how many steps are
needed but my approach has been to run a small number of parallel
chains, which are independent, in order to estimate the statistical
error produced. This is a slightly less computationally efficient
because it requires throwing away those <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps generated before convergence
multiple times but it is a conceptually simple workaround.</p>
<p>In summary, to do efficient simulations we want to reduce both the
convergence time and the auto-correlation time as much as possible. In
order to explain how, we need to introduce the Metropolis-Hasting (MH)
algorithm and how it gives an explicit form for the transition
function.</p>
<h2 id="the-metropolis-hastings-algorithm-1">The Metropolis-Hastings
Algorithm</h2>
<p>MH breaks up the transition function into a proposal distribution
<span class="math inline">\(q(\s \to \s&#39;)\)</span> and an acceptance
function <span class="math inline">\(\A(\s \to \s&#39;)\)</span>. <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> needs to be something that we can
directly sample from, and in our case generally takes the form of
flipping some number of spins in <span
class="math inline">\(\s\)</span>, i.e if we’re flipping a single random
spin in the spin chain, <span class="math inline">\(q(\s \to
\s&#39;)\)</span> is the uniform distribution on states reachable by one
spin flip from <span class="math inline">\(\s\)</span>. This also gives
the nice symmetry property that <span class="math inline">\(q(\s \to
\s&#39;) = q(\s&#39; \to \s)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The proposal <span class="math inline">\(\s&#39;\)</span> is then
accepted or rejected with an acceptance probability <span
class="math inline">\(\A(\s \to \s&#39;)\)</span>, if the proposal is
rejected then <span class="math inline">\(\s_{i+1} = \s_{i}\)</span>.
Hence:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\T(x\to x&#39;) = q(x\to x&#39;)\A(x \to
x&#39;)\]</span></p>
<p>When the proposal distribution is symmetric as ours is, it cancels
out in the expression for the acceptance function and the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is simply the choice: <span
class="math display">\[\A(x \to x&#39;) = \min\left(1, e^{-\beta\;\Delta
F}\right)\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the
overall free energy of the system, including both the quantum and
classical sector.</p>
<p>To implement the acceptance function in practice we pick a random
number in the unit interval and accept if it is less than <span
class="math inline">\(e^{-\beta\;\Delta F}\)</span>:</p>

<p>This has the effect of always accepting proposed states that are
lower in energy and sometimes accepting those that are higher in energy
than the current state.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-proposal-distribution">Choosing the proposal
distribution</h2>
<p><img src="figs/lsr/autocorr_multiple_proposals.png" title="fig:"
id="fig:comparison"
alt="t = 1, \alpha = 1.25, J = U = 5 [fig:comparison]" /> Simulations
showing how the autocorrelation of the order parameter depends on the
proposal distribution used at different temperatures, we see that at
<span class="math inline">\(T = 1.5 &lt; T_c\)</span> a single spin flip
is likely the best choice, while at the high temperature <span
class="math inline">\(T = 2.5 &gt; T_c\)</span> flipping two sites or a
mixture of flipping two and 1 sites is likely a better choice.</p>
<p>Now we can discuss how to minimise the auto-correlations. The general
principle is that one must balance the proposal distribution between two
extremes. Choose overlay small steps, like flipping only a single spin
and the acceptance rate will be high because <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta F\)</span> will usually be small, but each
state will be very similar to the previous and the auto-correlations
will be high too, making sampling inefficient. On the other hand,
overlay large steps, like randomising a large portion of the spins each
step, will result in very frequent rejections, especially at low
temperatures.</p>
<p>I evaluated a few different proposal distributions for use with the
FK model.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Flipping a single random site</p></li>
<li><p>Flipping N random sites for some N</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing n from Uniform(1, N) and then flipping n sites for some
fixed N.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempting to tune the proposal distribution for each parameter
regime.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Fro Figure <a href="#fig:comparison" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:comparison">4</a> we see that even at moderately
high temperatures <span class="math inline">\(T &gt; T_c\)</span>
flipping one or two sites is the best choice. However for some
simulations at very high temperature flipping more spins is warranted.
Tuning the proposal distribution automatically seems like something that
would not yield enough benefit for the additional complexity it would
require.</p>
<h2 id="two-step-trick-2">Two Step Trick</h2>
<p>Our method already relies heavily on the split between the classical
and quantum sector to derive a sign problem free MCMC algorithm but it
turns out that there is a further trick we can play with it. The free
energy term is the sum of an easy to compute classical energy and a more
expensive quantum free energy, we can split the acceptance function into
two in such as way as to avoid having to compute the full exact
diagonalisation some of the time:</p>
