<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>The practical implementation of what is described in this section is
available as a Python package called Koala (Kitaev On Amorphous
LAttices) <span class="citation"

<h2>Voronisation</h2>
<p>To study the properties of the amorphous Kitaev model, we need to
sample from the space of possible trivalent graphs.</p>
<p>A simple method is to use a Voronoi partition of the torus <span
class="citation"
data-cites="mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018 marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020 florescu_designer_2009"> [<a
href="#ref-mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>–<a href="#ref-florescu_designer_2009"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. We start by sampling <em>seed
points</em> uniformly (or otherwise) on the torus. Then, we compute the
partition of the torus into regions closest (with a Euclidean metric) to
each seed point. The straight lines (if the torus is flattened out) at
the borders of these regions become the edges of the new lattice. The
points where they intersect become the vertices.</p>
<p>The graph generated by a Voronoi partition of a two dimensional
surface is always planar. This means that no edges cross each other when
the graph is embedded into the plane. It is also trivalent in that every
vertex is connected to exactly three edges <strong>cite</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would sample uniformly from the space of possible
trivalent graphs. Indeed, there has been some work on how to do this
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach <span class="citation"
data-cites="alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016"> [<a
href="#ref-alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. However, it does not guarantee that
the resulting graph is planar, which we must ensure so that the edges
can be 3-coloured.</p>
<p>In practice, we use a standard algorithm <span class="citation"
data-cites="barberQuickhullAlgorithmConvex1996"> [<a
href="#ref-barberQuickhullAlgorithmConvex1996"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span> from Scipy <span class="citation"
data-cites="virtanenSciPyFundamentalAlgorithms2020"> [<a
href="#ref-virtanenSciPyFundamentalAlgorithms2020"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span> which computes the Voronoi partition
of the plane. To compute the Voronoi partition of the torus, we take the
seed points and replicate them into a repeating grid. This will be
either 3x3 or, for very small numbers of seed points, 5x5. Then, we
identify edges in the output to construct a lattice on the torus.</p>

<section id="graph-representation" class="level2">
<h2>Graph Representation</h2>
<p>Three keys pieces of information allow us to represent amorphous
lattices.</p>
<p>Most of the graph connectivity is encoded by an ordered list of edges
<span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>. These are ordered to
represent both directed and undirected graphs. This is useful for
defining the sign of bond operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} =
- u_{ji}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Information about the embedding of the lattice onto the torus is
encoded into a point on the unit square associated with each vertex. The
torus is unwrapped onto the square by defining an arbitrary pair of cuts
along the major and minor axes. For simplicity, we take these axes to be
the lines <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>. We can wrap the unit square back
up into a torus by identifying the lines <span class="math inline">\(x =
0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(y
= 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to encode the topology of the graph. This is
necessary because, if we are simply given an edge <span
class="math inline">\((i, j)\)</span> we do not know how the edge gets
from vertex i to vertex j. One method would be taking the shortest path,
but it could also ‘go the long way around’ by crossing one of the cuts.
To encode this information, we store an additional vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> associated with each edge. <span
class="math inline">\(r_i^x = 0\)</span> means that edge i does not
cross the x. <span class="math inline">\(r_i^x = +1\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>) means it crossed the cut in a
positive (negative) sense.</p>
<p>This description of the lattice has a very nice relationship to
Bloch’s theorem. Applying Bloch’s theorem to a periodic lattice
essentially means wrappping the unit cell onto a torus. Variations that
happen at longer length scales than the size of the unit cell are
captured by the crystal momentum. The crystal momentum inserts a phase
factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{i \vec{q}\cdot\vec{r}}\)</span>
onto bonds that cross to adjacent unit cells. The vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is exactly what we use to encode
the topology of our lattices.</p>

<section id="colouring-the-bonds" class="level2">
<h2>Colouring the Bonds</h2>
<p>The Kitaev Model requires that each edge in the lattice be assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, such that each vertex has exactly one
edge of each type connected to it. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> be the maximum degree of a graph
which, in our case, is 3. If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta &gt;
3\)</span>, it is obviously not possible to three-colour the edges.
However, the general theory of when this is and is not possible for
graphs with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \leq 3\)</span> is more
subtle.</p>
<p>In the graph theory literature, graphs where all vertices have degree
three are commonly called cubic graphs. There is no term for graphs with
maximum degree three. Planar graphs are graphs which can be embedded
onto the plane without any edges crossing. Bridgeless graphs do not
contain any edges that, when removed, would partition the graph into
disconnected components.</p>
<p>This problem must be distinguished from that considered by the famous
four-colour theorem <span class="citation"
data-cites="appelEveryPlanarMap1989"> [<a
href="#ref-appelEveryPlanarMap1989" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>.
The 4-colour theorem is concerned with assigning colours to the
<strong>vertices</strong> of a graph, such that no vertices that share
an edge have the same colour. Here we are concerned with an edge
colouring.</p>
<p>The four-colour theorem applies to planar graphs, those that can be
embedded onto the plane without any edges crossing. Here we are
concerned with Toroidal graphs, which can be embedded onto the torus
without any edges crossing. In fact, toroidal graphs require up to seven
colours <span class="citation"
data-cites="heawoodMapColouringTheorems"> [<a
href="#ref-heawoodMapColouringTheorems"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. The complete graph <span
class="math inline">\(K_7\)</span> is a good example of a toroidal graph
that requires seven colours.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta + 1\)</span> colours are enough to
edge-colour any graph. An <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(mn)\)</span> algorithm exists to do it
for a graph with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices <span class="citation"
data-cites="gEstimateChromaticClass1964"> [<a
href="#ref-gEstimateChromaticClass1964"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>. Restricting ourselves to graphs with
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta = 3\)</span> like ours, those can be
four-edge-coloured in linear time <span class="citation"

href="#ref-skulrattanakulchai4edgecoloringGraphsMaximum2002"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>However, three-edge-colouring them is more difficult. Cubic, planar,
bridgeless graphs can be three-edge-coloured if and only if they can be
four-face-coloured <span class="citation"
data-cites="tait1880remarks"> [<a href="#ref-tait1880remarks"

this extends to cubic, <strong>toroidal</strong> bridgeless graphs.</p>

<h3>Four-colourings and three-colourings</h3>
<p><strong>add diagram of this</strong></p>
<p>A four-face-colouring can be converted into a three-edge-colouring
quite easily: 1. Assume the faces of G can be four-coloured with labels
(0,1,2,3) 2. Label each edge of G according to <span
class="math inline">\(i + j \;\textrm{mod}\; 3\)</span> where i and j
are the labels of the face adjacent to that edge. For each edge label
there are two face label pairs that do not share any face labels. i,e
the edge label <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> can come about
either from faces <span class="math inline">\(0 + 3\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(1 + 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Explicitly, the mapping from face labels to edge labels is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
0 + 3 \;\mathrm{or}\; 1 + 2 &amp;= 0 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
0 + 1 \;\mathrm{or}\; 2 + 3 &amp;= 1 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
0 + 2 \;\mathrm{or}\;1 + 3 &amp;= 2 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>In a cubic planar G, a vertex v in G is always part of three
faces and the colours of those faces determine the colours of the edges
that connect to v. The three faces must take three distinct colours from
the set <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>From there, one can easily be convinced that those three distinct
face colours can never produce repeated edge colours according to the
<span class="math inline">\(i+j \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\)</span>
rule.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This implies that all cubic planar graphs are three-edge-colourable.
This does not apply to toroidal graphs. We have not yet generated a
Voronoi lattices on the torus that is not three-edge-colourable. This
suggests that Voronoi lattices may have additional structures that make
them three-edge-colourable. Intuitively, it seems that the kinds of
toroidal graphs that cannot be three-edge-coloured could never be
generated by a Voronoi partition with more than a few seed points.</p>

<section id="finding-lattice-colourings-with-minisat" class="level3">
<h3>Finding Lattice colourings with miniSAT</h3>
<p>Some issues are harder in theory than in practice.
Three-edge-colouring cubic toroidal graphs appears to be one of those
things.</p>
<p>To find colourings, we use a Boolean Satisfiability Solver or SAT
solver. A SAT problem is a set of statements about some number of
boolean variables , such as “<span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> or
not <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span> is true”, and looks for an
assignment <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in {0,1}\)</span> that
satisfies all the statements <span class="citation"
data-cites="Karp1972"> [<a href="#ref-Karp1972"
role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>General purpose, high performance programs for solving SAT problems
have been an area of active research for decades <span class="citation"
data-cites="alounehComprehensiveStudyAnalysis2019"> [<a
href="#ref-alounehComprehensiveStudyAnalysis2019"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>. Such programs are useful because,
by the Cook-Levin theorem, any NP problem can be encoded in polynomial
time as an instance of a SAT problem . This property is what makes SAT
one of the subset of NP problems called NP-Complete <span
class="citation"
data-cites="cookComplexityTheoremprovingProcedures1971 levin1973universal"> [<a
href="#ref-cookComplexityTheoremprovingProcedures1971"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a>,<a href="#ref-levin1973universal"
role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a relatively standard technique in the computer science
community to solve NP problems by first transforming them to SAT
instances and then using an off the shelf SAT solver. The output of this
can then be mapped back to the original problem domain.</p>
<p>NP problems can be loosely considered as those which do not have a
special structure than can be exploited to compute their solution in
polynomial time. Our three-edge-colouring problem is likely not in NP.
However, since we do not know what special structure it might have that
could be used to speed up its solution, using a SAT solver appears to be
a reasonable first method to try. As will be discussed later, this
turned out to work well enough and looking for a better solution was not
necessary.</p>
<p>We use a solver called <code>MiniSAT</code> <span class="citation"
data-cites="imms-sat18"> [<a href="#ref-imms-sat18"
role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span>. Like most modern SAT solvers,
<code>MiniSAT</code> requires the input problem to be specified in
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). CNF requires that the constraints be
encoded as a set of <em>clauses</em> of the form <span
class="math display">\[x_1 \;\textrm{or}\; -x_3 \;\textrm{or}\;
x_5\]</span> that contain logical ORs of some subset of the variables
where any of the variables may also be logically NOT’d, which we
represent by negation here.</p>
<p>A solution of the problem is one that makes all the clauses
simultaneously true.</p>
<p>We encode the edge colouring problem by assigning <span
class="math inline">\(3B\)</span> boolean variables to each of the <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> edges of the graph, <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i\alpha}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i\alpha} = 1\)</span> indicates that edge <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has colour <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>For edge colouring graphs we need two types of constraints: 1. Each
edge is exactly one colour. 2. No neighbouring edges are the same
colour.</p>
<p>The first constraint is a product of doing this mapping to boolean
variables. The solver does not know anything about the structure of the
problem unless it is encoded into the variables.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have three variables that correspond to particular edge
being red <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, green <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> or blue <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>To require that exactly one of the variables be true, we can enforce
that no pair of variables be true:
<code>-(r and b) -(r and g) -(b and g)</code></p>
<p>However, these clauses are not in CNF form. Therefore, we also have
to use the fact that <code>-(a and b) = (-a OR -b)</code>. To enforce
that at least one of these is true we simply OR them all together
<code>(r or b or g)</code></p>
<p>To encode the fact that no adjacent edges can have the same colour,
we emit a clause that, for each pair of adjacent edges, they cannot be
both red, both green or both blue.</p>
<p>We get a solution or set of solutions from the solver, which we can
map back to a labelling of the edges. fig. <a
href="#fig:multiple_colourings">3</a> shows some examples.</p>
<p>The solution presented here works well enough for our purposes. It
does not take up a substantial fraction of the overall computation time,
see +fig:times but other approaches could likely work.</p>
<p>When translating problems to CNF form, there is often some
flexibility. For instance, we used three boolean variables to encode the
colour of each edge and, then, additional constraints to require that
only one of these variables be true. An alternative method which we did
not try would be to encode the label of each edge using two variables,
yielding four states per edge, and then add a constraint that one of the
states, say (true, true) is disallowed. This would, however, have added
some complexity to the encoding of the constraint that no adjacent edges
can have the same colour.</p>
<p>The popular <em>Networkx</em> Python library uses a greedy graph
colouring algorithm. It simply iterates over the vertices/edges/faces of
a graph and assigns them a colour that is not already disallowed. This
does not work for our purposes because it is not designed to look for a
particular n-colouring. However, it does include the option of using a
heuristic function that determine the order in which vertices will be
coloured <span class="citation"

<h3>Does it matter which colouring we choose?</h3>
<p>In the isotropic case <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha =
1\)</span>, it is easy to show that choosing a particular valid
colouring cannot make a difference. As the choice of how we define the
four Majoranas at a site is arbitrary, we can define a local operator
that transforms the colouring of any particular site to another
permutation. The operators commute with the Hamiltonian and, by
composing such operators, we can transform the Hamiltonian generated by
one colouring into that generated by another.</p>
<p>We cannot do this in the anisotropic case. It remains an open
question whether particular physical properties could arise by
engineering the colouring in this phase though we expect them to exhibit
a self averaging behaviour.</p>

<h2>Mapping between flux sectors and bond sectors</h2>

sector makes it unwieldy to work with. Therefore, we need a way to

<h2>Chern Markers</h2>
<p>We know that the standard Kitaev model supports both Abelian and
non-Abelian phases. Therefore, how can we assess whether this is also
the case for the amorphous Kitaev model?</p>
<p>We have already discussed the fact that topology and anyonic
statistics are intimately linked. This will help here. The Chern number
is a quantity that measures the topological characteristics of a
material.</p>
<p>The original definition of the Chern number relies on the model
having translation symmetry. This leads to the development of <em>local
markers</em>. These are operators that generalise the notion of the
Chern number to an observable over some region smaller than the entire
system.</p>
<p><strong>Expand on definition here</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss link between Chern number and Anyonic
Statistics</strong></p>
