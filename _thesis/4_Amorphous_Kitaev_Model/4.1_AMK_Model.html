<p>The material in this chapter expands on work presented in</p>
<p><strong>Insert citation of amorphous Kitaev paper here</strong></p>
<p>which was a joint project of the first three authors with advice and
guidance from Willian and Johannes. The project grew out of an interest
Gino, Peru and I had in studying amorphous systems, coupled with
Johannes’ expertise on the Kitaev model. The idea to use voronoi
partitions came from <span class="citation"
data-cites="marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpe2020"> [<a
href="#ref-marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpe2020"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> and Gino did the implementation of
this. The idea and implementation of the edge colouring using SAT
solvers, the mapping from flux sector to bond sector using A* search
were both entirely my work. Peru came up with the ground state
conjecture and implemented the local markers. Gino and I did much of the
rest of the programming for Koala while pair programming and
’whiteboard’ing, this included the phase diagram, edge mode and finite
temperature analyses as well as the derivation of the projector in the
amorphous case.</p>

<p>The Kitaev Honeycomb model <span class="math display">\[H =  -
\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha},\]</span> is remarkable
because it combines three key properties.</p>
<p>First, the form of the Hamiltonian plausibly be realised by a real
material. Candidate materials, such as <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\mathrm{-RuCl}_3\)</span>, are known to have
sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling and the correct lattice
structure to behave according to the Kitaev Honeycomb model with small
corrections <span class="citation"
data-cites="banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016 trebstKitaevMaterials2022"> [<a

<p><strong>expand later: Why do we need spin orbit coupling and what
will the corrections be?</strong></p>
<p>Second, its ground state is the canonical example of the long sought
after quantum spin liquid state. Its excitations are anyons, particles
that can only exist in two dimensions that break the normal
fermion/boson dichotomy. Anyons have been the subject of much attention
because, among other reasons, they can be braided through spacetime to
achieve noise tolerant quantum computations <span class="citation"
data-cites="freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"> [<a
href="#ref-freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, this model is a rare many body
interacting quantum system that can be treated analytically. It is
exactly solvable. We can explicitly write down its many body ground
states in terms of single particle states <span class="citation"
data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"> [<a
href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. The solubility of the Kitaev
Honeycomb Model, like the Falikov-Kimball model of chapter 1, comes
about because the model has extensively many conserved degrees of
freedom. These conserved quantities can be factored out as classical
degrees of freedom, leaving behind a non-interacting quantum model that
is easy to solve.</p>

<h2>Amorphous Systems</h2>
<p><strong>Insert discussion of why a generalisation to the amorphous
case is interesting</strong></p>
<p>This chapter details the physics of the Kitaev model on amorphous
lattices.</p>
<p>It starts by expanding on the physics of the Kitaev model. It will
look at the gauge symmetries of the model as well as its solution via a
transformation to a Majorana hamiltonian. This discussion shows that,
for the the model to be solvable, it needs only be defined on a
trivalent, tri-edge-colourable lattice <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nussinov2009"> [<a href="#ref-Nussinov2009"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The methods section discusses how to generate such lattices and
colour them. It also explain how to map back and forth between
configurations of the gauge field and configurations of the gauge
invariant quantities.</p>
<p>The results section begins by looking at the zero temperature
physics. It presents numerical evidence that the ground state of the
Kitaev model is given by a simple rule depending only on the number of
sides of each plaquette. It assesses the gapless, Abelian and
non-Abelian, phases that are present, characterising them by the
presence of a gap and using local Chern markers. Next it looks at
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and topological edge states. It
also compares the zero temperature phase diagram to that of the Kitaev
Honeycomb Model. Finally, we introduce flux disorder and demonstrate
that there is a phase transition to a thermal metal state.</p>
<p>The discussion considers possible physical realisations of this model
and the motivations for doing so. It also discusses how a well known
quantum error correcting code defined on the Kitaev Honeycomb model
could be generalised to the amorphous case.</p>

<h3>Commutation relations</h3>
<p>Before diving into the Hamiltonian of the Kitaev model, the following
describes the key commutation relations of spins, fermions and
Majoranas.</p>
<section id="spins" class="level4">
<h4>Spins</h4>
<p>Skip this is you are familiar with the algebra of the Pauli matrices.
Scalars like <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ij}\)</span> should be
understood to be multiplied by an implicit identity <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{1}\)</span> where necessary.</p>
<p>We can represent a single spin<span
class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span> particle using the Pauli matrices
<span class="math inline">\((\sigma^x, \sigma^y, \sigma^z) =
\vec{\sigma}\)</span>, these matrices all square to the identity <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\alpha = \mathbb{1}\)</span>
and obey nice commutation and exchange rules: <span
class="math display">\[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta = \delta^{\alpha
\beta} + i \epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[[\sigma^\alpha, \sigma^\beta] = 2 i
\epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma\]</span></p>
<p>Adding site indices, spins at different spatial sites always commute
<span class="math inline">\([\vec{\sigma}_i, \vec{\sigma}_j] =
0\)</span> so when <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\sigma_i^\alpha \sigma_j^\beta = \sigma_j^\alpha
\sigma_i^\beta\]</span> <span class="math display">\[[\sigma_i^\alpha,
\sigma_j^\beta] = 0\]</span> while the previous equations hold for <span
class="math inline">\(i = j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two extra relations useful for the Kitaev model are the value of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta
\sigma^\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\sigma^\alpha
\sigma^\beta, \sigma^\gamma]\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma\)</span> these can
be computed relatively easily by applying the above relations yielding:
<span class="math display">\[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta \sigma^\gamma =
i \epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta, \sigma^\gamma] =
0\]</span></p>
</section>
<section id="fermions-and-majoranas" class="level4">
<h4>Fermions and Majoranas</h4>
<p>The fermionic creation and anhilation operators are defined by the
canonical anticommutation relations <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\{f_i, f_j\} &amp;= \{f^\dagger_i, f^\dagger_j\} = 0\\
\{f_i, f^\dagger_j\} &amp;= \delta_{ij}
\end{aligned}\]</span> which give us the exchange statistics and Pauli
exclusion principle.</p>
<p>From fermionic operators, we can construct Majorana operators: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_i         &amp;= 1/2 (a_i + ib_i)\\
f^\dagger_i &amp;= 1/2(a_i - ib_i)\\
a_i         &amp;= f_i + f^\dagger_i = 2\Re f\\
b_i         &amp;= 1/i(f_i - f^\dagger_i) = 2\Im f
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Majorana operators are the real and imaginary parts of the fermionic
operators. Physically, they correspond to the orthogonal superpositions
of the presence and absence of the fermion and are, thus, a kind of
quasiparticle.</p>
<p>Once we involve multiple fermions, there is some freedom in how we
can perform the transformation from <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> fermions <span
class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> Majoranas <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>. The property that must be preserved,
however, is that the Majoranas still anticommute:</p>

2\delta_{ij}\]</span></p>

<h3>The Hamiltonian</h3>
<p>To start from the fundamentals, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is a model
of interacting spin<span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span>s on the
vertices of a honeycomb lattice. Each bond in the lattice is assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \{ x, y, z\}\)</span> and
that bond couples its two spin neighbours along the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> axis. See fig. <a
href="#fig:visual_kitaev_1">2</a> for a diagram.</p>
<p>This gives us the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[H =  -
\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha_j\)</span> is a Pauli matrix acting
on site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha\)</span> is a pair of
nearest-neighbour indices connected by an <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-bond with exchange coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"> [<a
href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. For notational brevity, it is useful
to introduce the bond operators <span class="math inline">\(K_{ij} =
\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a function of <span
class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> that picks the correct bond type.</p>
<p>This Kitaev model has a set of conserved quantities that, in the spin
language, take the form of Wilson loop operators <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> winding around a closed path on the
lattice. The direction does not matter, but we will keep to clockwise
here. We will use the term plaquette and the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to refer to a Wilson loop operator
that does not enclose any other sites, such as a single hexagon in a
honeycomb lattice.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_p = \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p}
K_{ij} = \sigma_1^z \sigma_2^x \sigma_2^y \sigma_3^y .. \sigma_n^y
\sigma_n^y \sigma_1^z\]</span></p>
<p><strong>add a diagram of a single plaquette with labelled site and
bond types</strong></p>
<p>In closed loops, each site appears twice in the product with two of
the three bond types. Applying <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha
\sigma^\beta = \epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma, \alpha \neq
\beta\)</span> then gives us a product containing a single Pauli matrix
associated with each site in the loop with the type of the
<em>outward</em> pointing bond. This shows that the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> associated with hexagons or shapes
with an even number of sides all square to 1 and, hence, have
eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>A bipartite lattice is composed of A and B sublattices with no
intra-sublattice edges, i.e. no A-A or B-B edges. Any closed loop must
begin and end at the same site. If we start at an A site, the loop must
go A-B-A-B… until it returns to the original site. It must, therefore,
contain an even number of edges to end on the same sublattice that it
started on.</p>
<p>As the honeycomb lattice is bipartite, there are no closed loops that
contain an even number of edges. Therefore, all the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> have eigenvalues <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> on bipartite lattices. Later, we
will show that plaquettes with an odd number of sides (odd plaquettes
for short) have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm
i\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 3:</span> The eigenvalues of
a loop or plaquette operators depend on the number of bonds in its

</figure>
</div>
<p>Remarkably, all of the spin bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> commute with all the Wilson loop
operators <span class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[[W_p, K_{ij}] = 0\]</span> We can prove this by
considering three cases: 1. neither <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is part of the loop 2. one of <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are part of the loop 3. both are part
of the loop</p>
<p>The first case is trivial. The other two require some algebra,
outlined in fig. <a href="#fig:visual_kitaev_2">4</a>.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 4:</span> Plaquette
operators are conserved.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Since the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of bond operators, it
commutes with the plaquette operators. This is helpful because it leads
to a simultaneous eigenbasis for the Hamiltonian and the plaquette
operators. We can, thus, work in <em>or “on”???</em> a basis in which
the eigenvalues of the plaquette operators take on a definite value and,
for all intents and purposes, act like classical degrees of freedom.
These are the extensively many conserved quantities that make the model
tractable.</p>
<p>Plaquette operators measure flux. We will find that the ground state
of the model corresponds to some particular choice of flux through each
plaquette. We will refer to excitations which flip the expectation value
of a plaquette operator away from the ground state as
<strong>vortices</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, fixing a configuration of the vortices partitions the many-body
Hilbert space into a set of ‘vortex sectors’ labelled by that particular
flux configuration <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i = \pm 1,\pm
i\)</span>.</p>

class="math inline">\(n_f = f^\dagger f, n_g = g^\dagger g\)</span> and
the total fermionic parity operator <span class="math inline">\(F_p =
(2n_f - 1)(2n_g - 1)\)</span> which can be used to divide their Fock
space up into even and odd parity subspaces. These subspaces are
separated by the addition or removal of one fermion.</p>
<p>From these two fermionic modes, we can build four Majorana operators:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
b^x &amp;= f + f^\dagger\\
b^y &amp;= -i(f - f^\dagger)\\
b^z &amp;= g + g^\dagger\\
c   &amp;= -i(g - g^\dagger)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The Majoranas obey the usual commutation relations, squaring to one
and anticommuting with each other. The fermions and Majorana live in a
four dimensional Fock space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>. We can therefore
identify the two dimensional space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> with one of the parity
subspaces of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>
which will be called the <em>physical subspace</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}_p\)</span>. Kitaev defines the
operator <span class="math display">\[D = b^xb^yb^zc\]</span> which can
be expanded to <span class="math display">\[D = -(2n_f - 1)(2n_g - 1) =
-F_p\]</span> and labels the physical subspace as the space spanned by
states for which <span class="math display">\[ D|\phi\rangle =
|\phi\rangle\]</span></p>
<p>We can also think of the physical subspace as whatever is left after
applying the projector <span class="math display">\[P  = \frac{1 -
D}{2}\]</span> This formulation will be useful for taking states that
span the extended space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{M}}\)</span> and projecting them
into the physical subspace.</p>
<p>So now, with the caveat that we are working in the physical subspace,
we can define new Pauli operators:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^x = i b^x c,\;
\tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c,\; \tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c\]</span></p>
<p>These extended space Pauli operators satisfy all the usual
commutation relations. The only difference is that if we evaluate <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^x \sigma^y \sigma^z = i\)</span>, we
instead get <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\sigma}^x\tilde{\sigma}^y\tilde{\sigma}^z = iD \]</span></p>
<p>This makes sense if we promise to confine ourselves to the physical
subspace <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="for-multiple-spins" class="level4">
<h4>For multiple spins</h4>
<p>This construction easily generalises to the case of multiple spins.
We get a set of 4 Majoranas <span class="math inline">\(b^x_j,\;
b^y_j,\;b^z_j,\; c_j\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(D_j =
b^x_jb^y_jb^z_jc_j\)</span> operator for every spin. For a state to be
physical, we require that <span class="math inline">\(D_j |\psi\rangle =
|\psi\rangle\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>From these each Pauli operator can be constructed: <span
class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^\alpha_j = i b^\alpha_j
c_j\]</span></p>
<p>This is where the magic happens. We can promote the spin hamiltonian
from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> into the extended
space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>, safe in
the knowledge that nothing changes so long as we only actually work with
physical states. The Hamiltonian <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{H} &amp;=  - \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_j^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_k^{\alpha}\\
          &amp;= \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
2J^{\alpha} (ib^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j) c_i c_j\\
          &amp;=  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha}
2J^{\alpha} \hat{u}_{ij} \hat{c}_i \hat{c}_j
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can factor out the Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij} = i b^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j\)</span>.
Note that these bond operators are not equal to the spin bond operators
<span class="math inline">\(K_{ij} = \sigma^\alpha_i \sigma^\alpha_j = -
\hat{u}_{ij} c_i c_j\)</span>. In what follows, we will work much more
frequently with the Majorana bond operators. Therefore, when we refer to
bond operators without qualification, we are referring to the Majorana
variety.</p>
<p>Similarly to the argument with the spin bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span>, we can quickly verify by
considering three cases that the Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> all commute with one another. They
square to one, so have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm
1\)</span>. They also commute with the <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>Importantly, the operators <span class="math inline">\(D_i = b^x_i
b^y_i b^z_i c_i\)</span> commute with <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> and, therefore, with <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}\)</span>. We will show later that the
action of <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> on a state is to flip
the values of the three <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>
bonds that connect to site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
Physically, this indicates that <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> is a gauge field with a high
degree of degeneracy.</p>
<p>In summary, Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are an emergent, classical, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z_2}\)</span> gauge field!</p>

<section id="partitioning-the-hilbert-space-into-bond-sectors"

<h3>Partitioning the Hilbert Space into Bond sectors</h3>
<p>Similarly to the story with the plaquette operators from the spin
language, we can divide the Hilbert space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> into sectors labelled by a
set of choices <span class="math inline">\(\{\pm 1\}\)</span> for the
value of each <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> operator which
we denote by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>. Since
<span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = -u_{ji}\)</span>, we can represent
the <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> graphically with an
arrow that points along each bond in the direction in which <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Once confined to a particular <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>, we can ‘remove the hats’
from the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij}\)</span>. The
hamiltonian becomes a quadratic, free fermion problem <span
class="math display">\[\tilde{H_u} =  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle
i,j\rangle_\alpha} 2J^{\alpha} u_{ij} c_i c_j\]</span> The ground state,
<span class="math inline">\(|\psi_u\rangle\)</span> can be found easily
as will be explained in the next part. At this point, we may wonder
whether the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span> are
confined entirely within the physical subspace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_p\)</span> and, indeed, we will see
that they are not. However, it will be helpful to first develop the
theory of the Majorana Hamiltonian further.</p>

<section id="the-majorana-hamiltonian" class="level2">
<h2>The Majorana Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>We now have a quadratic Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{H} =  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha} 2J^{\alpha}
u_{ij} c_i c_j\]</span> in which most of the Majorana degrees of freedom
have paired along bonds to become a classical gauge field <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>. What follows is relatively
standard theory for quadratic Majorana Hamiltonians <span
class="citation" data-cites="BlaizotRipka1986"> [<a
href="#ref-BlaizotRipka1986" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Because of the antisymmetry of the matrix with entries <span
class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>, the eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span> come in
pairs <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span>. This
redundant information is a consequence of the doubling of the Hilbert
space which occurred when we transformed to the Majorana
representation.</p>
<p>If we organise the eigenmodes of <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> into pairs, such that <span
class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b_m&#39;\)</span> have energies <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-\epsilon_m\)</span>, we can construct the
transformation <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[(c_1, c_2... c_{2N}) Q = (b_1, b_1&#39;, b_2,
b_2&#39; ... b_{N}, b_{N}&#39;)\]</span> and put the Hamiltonian into
the form <span class="math display">\[\tilde{H}_u = \frac{i}{2} \sum_m
\epsilon_m b_m b_m&#39;\]</span></p>
<p>The determinant of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> will be
useful later when we consider the projector from <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>. Otherwise, the <span
class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> are merely an intermediate step. From
them, we form fermionic operators <span class="math display">\[ f_i =
\tfrac{1}{2} (b_m + ib_m&#39;)\]</span> with their associated number
operators <span class="math inline">\(n_i = f^\dagger_i f_i\)</span>.
These let us write the Hamiltonian neatly as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_u = \sum_m \epsilon_m (n_m -
\tfrac{1}{2}).\]</span></p>
<p>The ground state <span class="math inline">\(|n_m = 0\rangle\)</span>
of the many body system at fixed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>
is then <span class="math display">\[E_{u,0} = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_m
\epsilon_m \]</span> We can construct any state from a particular choice
of <span class="math inline">\(n_m = 0,1\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we only care about the value of <span
class="math inline">\(E_{u,0}\)</span>, it is possible to skip forming
the fermionic operators. The eigenvalues obtained directly from
diagonalising <span class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>
come in <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span> pairs. We
can take half the absolute value of the whole set to recover <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_m \epsilon_m\)</span> easily.</p>
<p>Takeaway: the Majorana Hamiltonian is quadratic within a Bond
Sector.</p>
<section id="mapping-back-from-bond-sectors-to-the-physical-subspace"
class="level3">
<h3>Mapping back from Bond Sectors to the Physical Subspace</h3>
<p>At this point, given a particular bond configuration <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = \pm 1\)</span>, we can construct a
quadratic Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span>
in the extended space and diagonalise it to find its ground state <span
class="math inline">\(|\vec{u}, \vec{n} = 0\rangle\)</span>. This is not
necessarily the ground state of the system as a whole, it is just the
lowest energy state within the subspace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span></p>
<p><strong>However, <span class="math inline">\(|u, n_m =
0\rangle\)</span> does not lie in the physical subspace</strong>. As an
example, consider the lowest energy state associated with <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = +1\)</span>. This state satisfies <span
class="math display">\[u_{ij} |\vec{u}=1, \vec{n} = 0\rangle =
|\vec{u}=1, \vec{n} = 0\rangle\]</span> for all bonds <span
class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we act on it, this state with one of the gauge operators <span
class="math inline">\(D_j = b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z c_j\)</span>, we see that
<span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> flips the value of the three
bonds <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> that surround site
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ |u&#39;\rangle = D_j |u=1, n_m =
0\rangle\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
\langle u&#39;|u_{ij}|u&#39;\rangle &amp;=  \langle u| b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z
c_j \;ib^x_i b^x_j\; b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z c_j|u\rangle\\
&amp;= -1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> commutes with the
Hamiltonian in the extended space <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}\)</span>, the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> flips the value of bond operators
indicates that there is a gauge degeneracy between the ground state of
<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span> and the set of <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_{u&#39;}\)</span> related to it by gauge
transformations <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>. Thus, we can
flip any three bonds around a vertex and the physics will stay the
same.</p>
<p>We can turn this into a symmetrisation procedure by taking a
superposition of every possible gauge transformation. Every possible
gauge transformation is just every possible subset of <span
class="math inline">\({D_0, D_1 ... D_n}\)</span> which can be neatly
expressed as <span class="math display">\[|\phi_w\rangle = \prod_i
\left( \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\right) |\tilde{\phi}_u\rangle\]</span> This is
convenient because the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1 +
D_i}{2}\)</span> is also the local projector onto the physical subspace.
Here <span class="math inline">\(|\phi_w\rangle\)</span> is a gauge
invariant state that lives in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_p\)</span> which has been constructed
from a set of states in different <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gauge degeneracy leads us to the next topic of discussion,
namely how to construct a set of gauge invariant quantities out of the
<span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>, these will turn out to just
be the plaquette operators.</p>
<p>Takeaway: The Bond Sectors overlap with the physical subspace but are
not contained within it.</p>
</section>
<section id="open-boundary-conditions" class="level3">
<h3>Open boundary conditions</h3>
<p>Care must be taken when defining open boundary conditions. Simply
removing bonds from the lattice leaves behind unpaired <span
class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators that must be paired in
some way to arrive at fermionic modes. To fix a pairing, we always start
from a lattice defined on the torus and generate a lattice with open
boundary conditions by defining the bond coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha}_{ij} = 0\)</span> for sites joined by
bonds <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> that we want to remove.
This creates fermionic zero modes <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> associated with these cut bonds
which we set to 1 when calculating the projector.</p>
<p>Alternatively, since all the fermionic zero modes are degenerate
anyway, an arbitrary pairing of the unpaired <span
class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators could be performed.
&lt;/i,j&gt;&lt;/i,j&gt;</p>
