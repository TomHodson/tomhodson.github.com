<p>The bond operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are
useful because they label a bond sector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}_u\)</span> in which we can
easy solve the Hamiltonian. However, the gauge operators move us between
bond sectors. <strong>Bond sectors are not gauge invariant!</strong></p>
<p>Let us consider instead the properties of the plaquette operators
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\phi}_i\)</span> that live on the faces
of the lattice.</p>
<p>We already showed that they are conserved. As one might hope and
expect, the plaquette operators also map cleanly onto the bond operators
of the Majorana representation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{W}_p &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} \tilde{K}_{ij}\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p}
\tilde{\sigma}_i^\alpha \tilde{\sigma}_j^\alpha\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} (ib^\alpha_i
c_i)(ib^\alpha_j c_j)\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} i u_{ij} c_i c_j\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} i u_{ij}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the last steps hold because each <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> appears exactly twice and is adjacent
to its neighbour in each plaquette operator. This is consistent with the
earlier observation that each <span class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span>
takes values <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> for even paths
and <span class="math inline">\(\pm i\)</span> for odd paths.</p>

<p>See fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">1</a> for a

<p>We started from the ground state of the model and flipped the sign of
a single bond (fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">1</a>
(a)). In doing so, we will flip the sign of the two plaquettes adjacent
to that bond. We will call these disturbed plaquettes <em>vortices</em>.
We will refer to a particular choice values for the plaquette operators
as a <em>vortex sector</em>.</p>
<p>If we chain multiple bond flips, we can create a pair of vortices at
arbitrary locations (fig. <a
href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">1</a> (b)). The chain of bonds
that we must flip corresponds to a path on the dual of the lattice.</p>
<p>We can also create a pair of vortices, move one around a loop and
finally annihilate it with its partner (fig. <a
href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">1</a> (c)). This corresponds to
a closed loop on the dual lattice. Applying such a bond flip leaves the
vortex sector unchanged. We can also do the same thing but move the
vortex around one the non-contractible loops of the lattice (fig. <a
href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">1</a> (d)).</p>

<p>Notice that the <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators
flip three bonds around a vertex. This is the smallest dual loop around
which one can move a vortex pair and then annihilate it with itself.</p>
<p>Such operations compose, so we can build any larger loop (almost) by
applying a series of <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
operations. The symmetrisation procedure <span
class="math inline">\(\prod_i \left( \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\right)\)</span>
that maps from the bond sector to a physical state is really
constructing a superposition over every such dual loops that leaves the
vortex sector unchanged.</p>
<p>There is one kind of dual loop that we cannot build out of <span

<p>Second, one can now easily show that the loops and plaquettes satisfy
nice composition rules, so long as we keep to loops that wind in a
particular direction.</p>
<p>Consider the product of two non-overlapping loops <span
class="math inline">\(W_a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(W_b\)</span> that share an edge <span
class="math inline">\(u_{12}\)</span>. Since the two loops both wind
clockwise and do not overlap, one will contain a term <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{12}\)</span> and the other <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{21}\)</span>. Since the <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> commute with one another, they
square to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = -u_{ji}\)</span>, we have <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{12} i u_{21} = 1\)</span>. We can repeat this
for any number of shared edges. Hence, we get a version of Stokes’
theorem: the product of <span class="math inline">\(i u_{jk}\)</span>
around any closed loop <span class="math inline">\(\partial A\)</span>
is equal to the product of plaquette operators <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> that span the area <span

class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathcal{T}}_y\)</span> that transform one
half of a vortex pair around the loop before annihilating them together
again, see later.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For the case of the torus where <span class="math inline">\(g =
1\)</span>, we can rearrange this to read: <span
class="math display">\[B = (P-1) + (V-1) + 2\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Bond Sectors</strong>: Each <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> takes two values and there is one
associated with each bond so there are exactly <span
class="math inline">\(2^B\)</span> distinct configurations of the bond
sector. Let us see if we can factor those configurations out into the
Cartesian product of vortex sectors, gauge symmetries and
non-contractible loop operators.</p>
<p><strong>Vortex sectors</strong>: Each plaquette operator <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> takes two values (<span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\pm
i\)</span>) and there are <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of
them. Vortices can only be created in pairs so there are <span
class="math inline">\(\tfrac{2^P}{2} = 2^{P-1}\)</span> vortex sectors
in total. Denoting the number of pairs of vortices as <span
class="math inline">\(N_v\)</span>, the vortex parity <span
class="math inline">\(1 - 2*(N_v \mod 2)\)</span> will be relevant in
the projector later.</p>
<p><strong>Gauge symmetries</strong>: As discussed earlier, these
correspond to all possible compositions of the <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators. Again, there are only
<span class="math inline">\(2^{V-1}\)</span> of these because, as we
will see in the next section, <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j} D_j
= \mathbb{1}\)</span> in the physical space. We enforce this by choosing
the correct product of single particle fermion states. One can get an
intuitive picture for why <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j} D_j =
\mathbb{1}\)</span> by imagining larger and larger patches of <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators on the torus. These patches
correspond to transporting a vortex pair around the edge of the patch.
At some point, the patch wraps around and starts to cover the entire
torus. As this happens, the boundary of the patch disappears and, hence,
it corresponds to the identity operation. See fig. <a
href="#fig:flood_fill">7</a> and fig. <a
href="#fig:flood_fill_amorphous">8</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Topological Sectors</strong>: Finally, the torus has two
non-contractible loop operators associated with its major and minor
diameters. These give us two extra fluxes <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_y\)</span> each with two distinct values.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, we see that there are <strong><span
class="math inline">\(2^B\)</span> bond sectors</strong> a space which
can be decomposed into the Cartesian product of <strong><span
class="math inline">\(2^{P-1}\)</span> vortex sectors</strong>,
<strong><span class="math inline">\(2^{V-1}\)</span> gauge
symmetries</strong> and <strong><span class="math inline">\(2^2 =
4\)</span> topological sectors</strong>.</p>
<p>The topological sector forms the basis of proposals to construct
topologically protected qubits since the four sectors can only be mixed
by a highly non-local perturbations<span class="citation"

<h3 id="counting-edges-plaquettes-and-vertices">Counting edges,
plaquettes and vertices</h3>
<p>It is useful to know how the trivalent structure of the lattice
constrains the number of bonds <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>,
plaquettes <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and vertices <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> it has.</p>
<p>The lattice is built from vertices that each share three edges with
their neighbours. This means that each vertex comes with <span
class="math inline">\(\tfrac{3}{2}\)</span> bonds i.e <span
class="math inline">\(3V = 2B\)</span>. This is consistent with the fact
that, in the Majorana representation on the torus, each vertex brings
three <span class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators which then
pair along bonds to give <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> bonds
per vertex.</p>
<p>If we define an integer <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(V = 2N\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B = 3N\)</span> and substitute this into the
polyhedra equation for the torus, we see that <span
class="math inline">\(P = N\)</span>. Therefore, if a trivalent lattice
on the torus has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes, it
has <span class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> bonds.</p>
<p>We can also consider the sum of the number of bonds in each plaquette
<span class="math inline">\(S_p\)</span>, since each bond is a member of
exactly two plaquettes <span class="math display">\[S_p = 2B =
6N\]</span></p>
<p>The mean size of a plaquette in a trivalent lattice on the torus is
exactly six. As the sum is even, this also tells us that all odd
plaquettes must come in pairs.</p>

<p>The physical states are defined as those for which <span
class="math inline">\(D_i |\phi\rangle = |\phi\rangle\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> has eigenvalues <span
class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span>, the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(\tfrac{(1+D_i)}{2}\)</span> has eigenvalue <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for physical states and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for extended states so is the local
projector onto the physical subspace.</p>
<p>Therefore, the global projector is <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{P} = \prod_{i=1}^{2N} \left( \frac{1 +
D_i}{2}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>for a toroidal trivalent lattice with <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> edges. As discussed earlier, the
product over <span class="math inline">\((1 + D_j)\)</span> can also be
thought of as the sum of all possible subsets <span
class="math inline">\(\{i\}\)</span> of the <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators, which is the set of all
possible gauge symmetry operations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{2^{2N}}
\sum_{\{i\}} \prod_{i\in\{i\}} D_i\]</span></p>
<p>Since the gauge operators <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
commute and square to one, we can define the complement operator <span
class="math inline">\(C = \prod_{i=1}^{2N} D_i\)</span> and see that it
takes each set of <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{i \in \{i\}}
D_j\)</span> operators and gives us the complement of that set. We will
shortly see why <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the identity
in the physical subspace, as noted earlier.</p>
<p>We use the complement operator to rewrite the projector as a sum over
half the subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\{i\}\)</span> -
referred to as <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. The
complement operator deals with the other half</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{P} =  \left(
\frac{1}{2^{2N-1}} \sum_{\Lambda} \prod_{i\in\{i\}} D_i\right)
\left(\frac{1 + \prod_i^{2N} D_i}{2}\right) = \mathcal{S} \cdot
\mathcal{P}_0\]</span></p>
<p>To compute <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0\)</span>, the
main quantity needed is the product of the local projectors <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\prod_i^{2N} D_i = \prod_i^{2N} b^x_i b^y_i b^z_i

class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> edges.</p>
<p>First, we reorder the operators by bond type. This does not require
any information about the underlying lattice.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\prod_i^{2N} D_i = \prod_i^{2N} b^x_i
\prod_i^{2N} b^y_i \prod_i^{2N} b^z_i \prod_i^{2N} c_i\]</span></p>
<p>The product over <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators

reordering the b operators such that pairs of vertices linked by the
corresponding bonds are adjacent.</p>

class="math inline">\(det(Q^u) \prod -i u_{ij}\)</span> has an
interesting relationship to the topological fluxes. In the non-Abelian
phase, we expect that it will change sign in exactly one of the four
topological sectors.</p>
<p>This means that the lowest state in three of the topological sectors
contain no fermions, while in one of them there must be one fermion to
preserve product of fermion vortex parity. So overall the non-Abelian
model has a three-fold degenerate ground state rather than the fourfold
of the Abelian case (and of my intuition!). In the Abelian phase, this
does not happen and we get a fourfold degenerate ground state.
<strong>Whether this analysis generalises to the amorphous case is
unclear.</strong></p>
<p>An alternative way to view this is to imagine we start in one state
of the ground state manifold. We then attempt to construct other ground
states by creating vortex pairs, transporting one vortex around one or
both non-contractible loops and then annihilating them. This works for
either of the two non-contractible loops but when we try to do it for
<em>both</em> something strange happens. When we transport a vortex
around <strong>both</strong> the major and minor axes of the torus this
changes its fusion channel. Normally two vortices fuse to the vacuum but
after this operation they fuse into a fermion excitation. And hence our
attempt to construct that last ground state doesn’t yield a ground state
at all, leaving us with just three.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE to self: This argument seems to involve adiabatic
insertion of the fluxes <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{x,y}\)</span>
as the operations that undo vortex transport around the lattice. I don’t

<h3 id="quick-breather">Quick Breather</h3>
<p>Let’s consider where are with the model now. We can map the spin
Hamiltonian to a Majorana Hamiltonian in an extended Hilbert space.
Along with that mapping comes a gauge field <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> defining <strong>bond
sectors</strong>. The gauge symmetries of <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> are generated by the set of <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators. The gauge invariant, and,
therefore, physically, relevant variables are the plaquette operators
<span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> which define as a
<strong>vortex sector</strong>. To solve the Majorana Hamiltonian, we
must remove hats from the gauge field by restricting ourselves to a
particular bond sector. At this stage, the Majorana Hamiltonian becomes
non-interacting and we can solve it like any quadratic theory. This lets
us construct the single particle eigenstates from which we can also
construct many body states. Yet, the many body states constructed in
this way are not in the physical subspace!</p>
<p>For the many body states within a particular bond sector, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0 = 0,1\)</span> tells us which of
those overlap with the physical sector.</p>
<p>We see that finding a state that has overlap with a physical state
only ever requires the addition or removal of one fermion. There are
cases where this can make a difference, but for most observables, such
as ground state energy, this correction scales away as the number of
fermions in the system grows.</p>
<p>If we wanted to construct a full many body wavefunction in the spin
basis, we would need to include the full symmetrisation over the gauge
fields. However, this was not necessary for any of the results that will
be presented here.</p>
<h2 id="the-ground-state">The Ground State</h2>
<p>We have shown that the Hamiltonian is gauge invariant. As a result,
only the flux sector and the two topological fluxes affect the spectrum
of the Hamiltonian. Thus, we can label the many body ground state by a
combination of fluxes and fermionic occupation numbers.</p>
<p>By studying the projector, we saw that the fermionic occupation
numbers of the ground state will always be either <span
class="math inline">\(n_m = 0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(n_0 = 1, n_{m&gt;1} = 0\)</span> because the
projector only enforces combined vortex and fermion parity.</p>
<p>I refer to the flux sector that contains the ground state as the
ground state flux sector. Recall that the excitations of the fluxes away
from the ground ground state configuration are called
<strong>vortices</strong>, so that the ground state flux sector is, by
definition, the vortex free sector.</p>
<p>On the Honeycomb, Lieb’s theorem implies that the ground state
corresponds to the state where all <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk} =
1\)</span>. This implies that the flux free sector is the ground state
sector<span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"><sup><a
href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Lieb’s theorem does not generalise easily to the amorphous case.
However, we can get some intuition by examining the problem that will
lead to a guess for the ground state. We will then provide numerical
evidence that this guess is in fact correct.</p>
<p>Consider the partition function of the Majorana hamiltonian: <span
class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = \mathrm{Tr}\left( e^{-\beta
H}\right) = \sum_i \exp{-\beta \epsilon_i}\]</span> At low temperatures
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z} \approx \beta
\epsilon_0\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is the lowest energy fermionic
state.</p>
<p>How does the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> depend
on the Majorana hamiltonian? Expanding the exponential out gives <span
class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = \sum_n \frac{(-\beta)^n}{n!}
\mathrm{Tr(H^k)} \]</span></p>
<p>This makes for an interesting observation. The Hamiltonian is
essentially a scaled adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix being a
matrix <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(g_{ij} = 1\)</span> if vertices <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and joined by an edge and 0
otherwise.</p>
<p>Powers of adjacency matrices have the property that the entry <span
class="math inline">\((g^n)_{ij}\)</span> corresponds to the number of
paths of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> on the graph that
begin at site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and end at site
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. These include somewhat
degenerate paths that go back on themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, the trace of an adjacency matrix <span
class="math display">\[\mathrm{Tr}(g^n) = \sum_i (g^n)_{ii}\]</span>
counts the number of loops of size <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that can be drawn on the graph.</p>
<p>Applying the same treatment to our Majorana Hamiltonian, we can
interpret <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> to equal 0 if the
two sites are not joined by a bond and we put ourselves in the isotropic
phase where <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha = 1\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_{ij} =  \tfrac{1}{2} i
u_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>We then see that the trace of the nth power of H is a sum over Wilson
loops of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with an additional
factor of <span class="math inline">\(2^{-n}\)</span>. We showed earlier
that the Wilson loop operators can always be written as products of the
plaquette operators that they enclose.</p>
<p>Lumping all the prefactors together, we will get something
schematically like: <span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = c_A
\hat{A} + c_B \hat{B} + \sum_i c_i \hat{\phi}_i + \sum_{ij}
c_{ij}  \hat{\phi}_i \hat{\phi}_j + \sum_{ijk} c_{ijk}  \hat{\phi}_i
\hat{\phi}_j \hat{\phi}_k + ...\]</span></p>
<p>Where the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> factors would be
something like <span class="math display">\[c_{ijk...} = \sum_n
\tfrac{(-\beta)^n}{n!} \tfrac{1}{2^n} K_{ijk...}\]</span> This is a sum
over all loop lengths <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with, for
each, a combinatorial factor <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ijk...}\)</span> that counts how many ways
exist to draw a loop of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
that only encloses plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(ijk...\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also have the pesky topological fluxes <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_y\)</span>. Again, the prefactors for these
are very complicated. However, we can intuitively see that for larger
and larger loops lengths, there will be a combinatorial explosion of
possible ways that they appear in these sums. We know that explosion
will be suppressed exponentially for sufficiently large system sizes but
for practical lattices they cause significant finite size effects.</p>
<p>We do not have much hope of actually evaluating this for an amorphous
lattice. However, we can guess that the ground state vortex sector might
be a simple function of the side length of each plaquette.</p>
<p>The ground state of the Amorphous Kitaev Model is found by setting
the flux through each plaquette <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to be equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\phi^{\mathrm{g.s.}}(n_{\mathrm{sides}})\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \phi^{\mathrm{g.s.}}(n_{\mathrm{sides}}) = -(\pm
i)^{n_{\mathrm{sides}}},
\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n_{\mathrm{sides}}\)</span> is the number of edges
that form each plaquette and the choice of sign gives a twofold chiral
ground state degeneracy.</p>
<p>This conjecture is consistent with Lieb’s theorem on regular
lattices<span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"><sup><a
href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> and
is supported by numerical evidence. As noted before, any flux that
differs from the ground state is an excitation which we call a
vortex.</p>
<h3 id="finite-size-effects">Finite size effects</h3>
<p>This guess only works for larger lattices. To rigorously test it, we
would want to directly enumerate the <span
class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> vortex sectors for a smaller lattice
and check that the lowest state found is the vortex sector predicted by
our conjecture.</p>
<p>To do this we tile an amorphous lattice as the unit cell of a
periodic <span class="math inline">\(N\times N\)</span> system. Bonds
that originally crossed the periodic boundaries now connect adjacent
unit cells. Using Bloch’s theorem, the problem essentially reduces back
to the single amorphous unit cell. However, now the edges that cross the
periodic boundaries pick up a phase dependent on the crystal momentum
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{q} = (q_x, q_y)\)</span> and the
lattice vector of the bond <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x} = (+1, 0,
-1, +1, 0, -1)\)</span>. Assigning these lattice vectors to each bond is
also a very convenient way to store and plot toroidal graphs.</p>
<p>This can then be solved using Bloch’s theorem. For a given crystal
momentum <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{q} \in [0,2\pi)^2\)</span>,
we are left with a Bloch Hamiltonian, which is identical to the original
Hamiltonian aside from an extra phase on edges that cross the periodic
boundaries in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> directions, <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    M_{jk}(\textbf{q}) =  \frac{i}{2} J^{\alpha} u_{jk} e^{i
q_{jk}},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q_{jk}
= q_x\)</span> for a bond that crosses the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-periodic boundary in the positive
direction, with the analogous definition for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-crossing bonds. We also have <span
class="math inline">\(q_{jk} = -q_{kj}\)</span>. Finally, <span
class="math inline">\(q_{jk} = 0\)</span> if the edge does not cross any
boundaries at all. In essence, we are imposing twisted boundary
conditions on our system. The total energy of the tiled system can be
calculated by summing the energy of <span class="math inline">\(M(
\textbf{q})\)</span> for every value of <span
class="math inline">\(\textbf{q}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With this technique, the finite size effects related to the
non-contractible loop operators are removed with only a linear penalty
in computation time compared to the exponential penalty paid by simply
diagonalising larger lattices.</p>
<p>This technique verifies that <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span> correctly predicts the ground
state for hundreds of thousands of lattices with up to twenty
plaquettes. For larger lattices, we verified that random perturbations
around the predicted ground state never yield a lower energy state.</p>
<h3 id="chiral-symmetry">Chiral Symmetry</h3>
<p>The discussion above shows that the ground state has a twofold
<strong>chiral</strong> degeneracy which arises because the global sign
of the odd plaquettes does not matter.</p>
<p>This happens because we have broken the time reversal symmetry of the
original model by adding odd plaquettes<span class="citation"

<p>Similarly to the behaviour of the original Kitaev model in response
to a magnetic field, we get two degenerate ground states of different
handedness. Practically speaking, one ground state is related to the
other by inverting the imaginary <span

<p>Most thermodynamic and quantum phases studied can be characterised by
a local order parameter. That is, a function or operator that only
requires knowledge about some fixed sized patch of the system that does
not scale with system size.</p>
<p>However, there are quantum phases that cannot be characterised by
such a local order parameter. These phases are instead said to possess
‘topological order’.</p>
<p>One easily observable property of topological order is that the
ground state degeneracy depends on the topology of the manifold that we
put the system on to. This is referred to as topological degeneracy to
distinguish it from standard symmetry breaking.</p>
<p>The Kitaev model is a good example. We have already looked at it
defined on a graph that is embedded either into the plane or onto the
torus. The extension to surfaces like the torus but with more than one
handle is relatively easy.</p>
<h3 id="anyonic-statistics">Anyonic Statistics</h3>
<p><strong>NB: I’m thinking about moving this section to the overall
intro, but it’s nice to be able to refer to specifics of the Kitaev
model also so I’m not sure. It currently repeats a discussion of the
ground state degeneracy from the projector section.</strong></p>
<p>In dimensions greater than two, the quantum state of a system must
pick up a factor of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> if two identical particles are
swapped. We call these Fermions and Bosons.</p>
<p>This argument is predicated on the idea that performing two swaps is
equivalent to doing nothing. Doing nothing should not change the quantum
state at all. Therefore, doing one swap can at most multiply it by <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, there are many hidden parts to this argument. First, this
argument does not present the whole story. For instance, if you want to
know why Fermions have half integer spin, you have to go to field
theory.</p>
<p>Second, why does this argument only work in dimensions greater than
two? When we say that two swaps do nothing, we in fact say that the
world lines of two particles that have been swapped twice can be
untangled without crossing. Why can’t they cross? Because if they cross,
the particles can interact and the quantum state could change in an
arbitrary way. We are implicitly using the locality of physics to argue
that, if the worldlines stay well separated, the overall quantum state
cannot change.</p>
<p>In two dimensions, we cannot untangle the worldlines of two particles
that have swapped places. They are braided together (see fig. <a
href="#fig:braiding">12</a>).</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>From this fact flows a whole of behaviours. The quantum state can
acquire a phase factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\phi}\)</span>
upon exchange of two identical particles, which we now call Anyons.</p>
<p>The Kitaev Model is a good demonstration of the connection between
Anyons and topological degeneracy. In the Kitaev model, we can create a
pair of vortices, move one around a non-contractable loop <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{x/y}\)</span> and then annihilate
them together. Without topology, this should leave the quantum state
unchanged. Instead, we move towards another ground state in a
topologically degenerate ground state subspace. Practically speaking, it
flips a dual line of bonds <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span>
going around the loop which we cannot undo with any gauge transformation
made from <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>If the ground state subspace is multidimensional, quasiparticle
exchange can move us around in the space with an action corresponding to
a matrix. In general, these matrices do not commute so these are known
as non-Abelian anyons.</p>
<p>From here, the situation becomes even more complex. The Kitaev model
has a non-Abelian phase when exposed to a magnetic field. The amorphous
Kitaev Model has a non-Abelian phase because of its broken chiral
symmetry.</p>
<p>By subdividing the Kitaev model into vortex sectors, we neatly
separate between vortices and fermionic excitations. However, if we
looked at the full many body picture, we would see that a vortex carries
with it a cloud of bound Majorana states.</p>

<p>Consider two processes</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We transport one half of a vortex pair around either the x or y
loops of the torus before annihilating back to the ground state vortex
sector <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{x,y}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We flip a line of bond operators corresponding to measuring the

class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\Phi}_{x,y}\)</span></p></li>

<p>The plaquette operators <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>
are associated with fluxes. Wilson loops that wind the torus are
associated with the fluxes through its two diameters <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\Phi}_{x,y}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the Abelian phase, we can move a vortex along any path at will
before bringing them back together. They will annihilate back to the
vacuum, where we understand ‘the vacuum’ to refer to one of the ground
states. However, this will not necessarily be the same ground state we
started in. We can use this to get from the <span
class="math inline">\((\Phi_x, \Phi_y) = (+1, +1)\)</span> ground state
and construct the set <span class="math inline">\((+1, +1), (+1, -1),

<p>However, in the non-Abelian phase we have to wrangle with
monodromy<span class="citation"
data-cites="chungExplicitMonodromyMoore2007 oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007"><sup><a

role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a
href="#ref-oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. Monodromy is the behaviour of
objects as they move around a singularity. This manifests here in that
the identity of a vortex and cloud of Majoranas can change as we wind
them around the torus in such a way that, rather than annihilating to
the vacuum, we annihilate them to create an excited state instead of a
ground state. This means that we end up with only three degenerate
ground states in the non-Abelian phase <span class="math inline">\((+1,
+1), (+1, -1), (-1, +1)\)</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010 yaoAlgebraicSpinLiquid2009"><sup><a
href="#ref-yaoAlgebraicSpinLiquid2009" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>,<a
href="#ref-chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010"
role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>. Concretely, this is because
the projector enforces both flux and fermion parity. When we wind a
vortex around both non-contractible loops of the torus, it flips the
flux parity. Therefore, we have to introduce a fermionic excitation to
make the state physical. Hence, the process does not give a fourth
ground state.</p>
<p>Recently, the topology has notably gained interest because of
proposals to use this ground state degeneracy to implement both
passively fault tolerant and actively stabilised quantum
computations<span class="citation"
