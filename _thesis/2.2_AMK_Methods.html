<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>The practical implemntation of what is described in this section is
available as a Python package called Koala (Kitaev On Amorphous
LAttices)<span class="citation"
data-cites="tomImperialCMTHKoalaFirst2022"><sup><a

role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> most of the figures shown were
generated with Koala.</p>
<h2 id="voronisation">Voronisation</h2>
<p>In order to study the properties of the amorphous Kitaev model we
need a way to sample from the space of possible trivalent graphs.</p>
<p>A very simple way to do this is to use a Voronoi partition of the
torus<span class="citation"
data-cites="mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018 marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020 florescu_designer_2009"><sup><a
href="#ref-mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a>–<a href="#ref-florescu_designer_2009"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. We start by sampling <em>seed
points</em> uniformly (or otherwise) on the torus. We then compute the
partition of the torus into regions closest (with a Euclidean metric) to
each seed point. The straight lines (if the torus is flattened out) at
the borders of these regions become the edges of the new lattice and the
points where they intersect beceme the vertices.</p>
<p>The graph generated by a Voronoi partition of a two dimensional
surface is always planar meaning that no edges cross eachother when the
graph is embedded into the plane. It is also trivalent in the sense that
every vertex is connected to exactly three edges
<strong>cite</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideally we might instead sample uniformly from the space of possible
trivalent graphs, and indeed there has been some work on how to do this
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach<span class="citation"
data-cites="alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016"><sup><a
href="#ref-alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>, however it does not gurantee
that the resulting graph is planar which we will need to ensure that the
edges can be 3-coloured.</p>
<p>In practice, we then use a standard algorithm<span class="citation"
data-cites="barberQuickhullAlgorithmConvex1996"><sup><a
href="#ref-barberQuickhullAlgorithmConvex1996"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> from scipy<span class="citation"
data-cites="virtanenSciPyFundamentalAlgorithms2020a"><sup><a
href="#ref-virtanenSciPyFundamentalAlgorithms2020a"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> which actually computes the
Voronoi partition of the plane. In order to compute the Voronoi
partition of the torus, I take the seed points and replicate them into a
repeating grid, either 3x3 (or for very small numbers of seed points
5x5). I then identify edges in the output to construct a lattice on the
torus.</p>

<h2 id="graph-representation">Graph Representation</h2>
<p>We represent the graph structure with an ordered list of edges <span
class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> so we can represent both directed
and undirected graphs which is useful for defining the sign of bond
operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = - u_{ji}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="coloring-the-bonds">Coloring the Bonds</h2>
<p>The Kitaev model requires that each edge in the lattice be assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that each vertex has exactly one
edge of each type connected to it. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> be the maximum degree of a graph
which in our case is 3. If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta &gt;
3\)</span> it is obviously not possible to 3 color the edges but the
general theory of when this is and isn’t possible for graphs with <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \leq 3\)</span> is more subtle.</p>
<p>In the graph theory literature, graphs where all vertices have degree
3 are commonly called cubic graphs, there is no term for graphs with
maximum degree 3. Planar graphs are those that can be embedded onto the
plane without any edges crossing. Bridgeless graphs do not contain any
edges that, when removed, would partition the graph into disconnected
components.</p>
<p>It’s important to be clear that this problem is different from that
considered by the famous 4 color theorem<span class="citation"
data-cites="appelEveryPlanarMap1989"><sup><a
href="#ref-appelEveryPlanarMap1989"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span> . The 4 color thorem is
concerned with assiging colours to the <strong>vertices</strong> of a
graph such that no vertices that share an edge are the same colour. Here
we are concerned with an edge colouring.</p>
<p>The four color theorem applies to planar graphs, those that can be
embedded onto the plane without any edges crossing. Here we are actually
concerned with Toroidal graphs which can be embedded onto the torus
without any edges crossing. In fact toroidal graphs require up to 7
colors<span class="citation"
data-cites="heawoodMapColouringTheorems"><sup><a
href="#ref-heawoodMapColouringTheorems"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span> . The complete graph <span
class="math inline">\(K_7\)</span> is a good example of a toroidal graph
that requires 7 colours.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta + 1\)</span> colours are enough to
edge-colour any graph and there is an <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(mn)\)</span> algorithm to do it for a
graph with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices<span class="citation"
data-cites="gEstimateChromaticClass1964"><sup><a
href="#ref-gEstimateChromaticClass1964"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. Restricting ourselves to
graphs with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = 3\)</span> like ours,
those can be 4-edge-coloured in linear time<span class="citation"

href="#ref-skulrattanakulchai4edgecoloringGraphsMaximum2002"
role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span> .</p>
<p>It’s trickier if we want to 3-edge-colour them however. Cubic, planar
bridgeless graphs can be 3-edge-coloured if and only if they can be
4-face-coloured<span class="citation"
data-cites="tait1880remarks"><sup><a href="#ref-tait1880remarks"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> . For which there is an <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\)</span> algorithm
robertson1996efficiently . However it is not clear whether this extends
to cubic, <strong>toroidal</strong> bridgeless graphs.</p>
<h4
id="face-colourablity-implies-3-edge-colourability">4-face-colourablity
implies 3-edge-colourability</h4>
<p>The proof of that 4-face-colourablity implies 3-edge-colourability
can be sketched out quite easily: 1. Assume the faces of G can be
4-coloured with labels (0,1,2,3) 2. Label each edge of G according to
<span class="math inline">\(i + j \mathrm{mod} 3\)</span> where i and j
are the labels of the face adjacent to that edge. For each edge label
there are two face label pairs that do not share any face labels. i,e
the edge label <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> can come about
either from faces <span class="math inline">\(0 + 3\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(1 + 2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
0 + 3 \;\mathrm{or}\; 1 + 2 &amp;= 0 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
0 + 1 \;\mathrm{or}\; 2 + 3 &amp;= 1 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
0 + 2 \;\mathrm{or}\;1 + 3 &amp;= 2 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In a cubic planar G, a vertex v in G is always part of 3 faces and
the colors of those faces determines the colors of the edges that
connect to v. The three faces must take three distinct colors from
(0,1,2,3).</li>
<li>From there’s easy to convince yourself that those three distinct
face colours can never produce repeated edge colours according to the
<span class="math inline">\(i+j \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\)</span> rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>This implies that all cubic planar graphs are 3-edge-colourable. It
does not apply to toroidcal graphs, however I have not yet generated a
voronoi lattices on the torus that is not 3-edge-colourable. This
suggests that perhaps voronoi lattices have additional structure that
makes them 3-edge-colourable. Intuitively, the kinds of toroidal graphs
that cannot be 3-edge-coloured look as if they could never be generated
by a voronoi partition with more than a few seed points.</p>
<h3 id="finding-lattice-colourings-in-practice-unfinished">Finding
Lattice colourings in practice (unfinished)</h3>
<p>Some things are harder in theory than in practice. 3-edge-colouring
cubic toroidal graphs appears to be one of those things.</p>
<p>The approach I take is relatively standard in the computer science
community for solving NP problems computationally. I don’t believe this
problem to be in NP but I tried it anyway.</p>
<p>The trick is to map the problem on into a Boolean Satisfiability
‘SAT’ problem<span class="citation" data-cites="Karp1972"><sup><a
href="#ref-Karp1972" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span>, use an
off the shelf solver, <code>MiniSAT</code><span class="citation"
data-cites="imms-sat18"><sup><a href="#ref-imms-sat18"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span>, and finally to map the problem
back to the original domain. While SAT solvers are very general, they
are also highly optimised and they do seem to yield good results for
this problem.</p>
<p>SAT solvers encode problems as constraints on some number of boolean
variables <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in {0,1}\)</span>. The
constraints must Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). CNF means the
constraints are encoded as a set of clauses of the form <span
class="math display">\[x_1 \;\textrm{or}\; \bar{x}_3 \;\textrm{or}\;
x_5\]</span> that containt logical ORs of some subset of the variables
where any of the variables may also be logical NOT’d which I represent
by over bars here.</p>
<p>A solution of the problem is one that makes all the clauses
simultaneously true.</p>
<p>I encode the edge colouring problem as a set of statements about a
set of boolean variables <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in
{0,1}\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> bonds we take
the <span class="math inline">\(3B\)</span> variables <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i\alpha}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i\alpha} = 1\)</span> indicates that edge <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has colour <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>For edge colouring graphs we need two kinds of constraints: 1. Each
edge is exactly one colour. 2. No neighbouring edges are the same
color.</p>
<p>The first constraint is a kind of artifact of doing this mapping over
to boolean variables, the solver doesn’t know anything about the
structure of the problem unless it is encoded into the variables.</p>
<p>The second constraint encodes the structure of the graph itself and
can be constructed easily from the adjacency matrix.</p>
<p>I’ll fill in the encoding later but the gist is that we can give this
to a solver and get back: whether the problem is solveable, a solution
or all the possible solutions. Finding a solution is relatively fast,
while finding all the solutions is slower since there appear to be
exponentially many of them. Fig <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:multiple_colourings}\)</span> shows some
examples.</p>

<h2 id="mapping-between-flux-sectors-and-bond-sectors">Mapping between
flux sectors and bond sectors</h2>
<p>Constructing the Majorana representation of the model requires the
particular bond configuration <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk} = \pm
1\)</span>. However the large number of gauge symmetries of the bond
sector make it unwieldly to work with. We therefore need a way to
quickly map between bond sectors and flux sectors.</p>
<p>Going from the bond sector to flux sector is easy since we can
compute it directly by taking the product of <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{jk}\)</span> around each plaquette <span
class="math display">\[ \phi_i = \prod_{(j,k) \; \in \; \partial \phi_i}
i u_{jk}\]</span></p>
<p>Going from flux sector to bond sector requires more thought however.
The algorithm I use is this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Fix the gauge by choosing some arbitrary <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> configuration. In practice I use
<span class="math inline">\(u_{jk} = +1\)</span>. This chooses an
arbitrary one of the 4 topological sectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the current flux configuration and how it differs from
the target one. Let’s call an plaquette that differs from the target a
defect.</p></li>
<li><p>Find any adjacent pairs of defects and flip the <span

isolated defects.</p></li>
<li><p>Pair the defects up using a greedy algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute paths along the dual lattice between each pair of
plaquettes. Flipping the corresponding set of <span

<p>Magnetic phases in amorphous systems have been investigated since the
1960s, mostly through the adaptation of theoretical tools developed for
disordered systems and numerical methods~. Research focused on classical
Heisenberg and Ising models which have been shown to account for
observed behavior of ferromagnetism, disordered antiferromagnetism and
widely observed spin glass behaviour~. However, the role of
spin-anisotropic interactions and quantum effects has not been
addressed. Similarly, it is an open question whether magnetic
frustration in amorphous quantum magnets can give rise to long-range
entangled quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases.</p>

starting point to study the overlooked possibility of QSLs in amorphous
magnets.</p>
In this letter, we study Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) stabilized by the
<span class="math inline">\(S=1/2\)</span> Kitaev model on coordination
number <span class="math inline">\(z=3\)</span> random networks
generated via Voronoi tessellation . On these lattices, the KSLs
generically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), as expected for any
Majorana QSL in graphs containing odd-sided plaquettes . An extensive
numerical study showed that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb
Z_2\)</span> gauge fluxes on the ground state can be described by a
conjecture consistent with Lieb’s theorem . In contrast to the honeycomb
case, the amorphous KSLs are gapless only along certain critical lines.
These manifolds separate two gapped KSLs that are topologically
differentiated by a local Chern number <span
class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> in analogy with the KSLs on the
decorated honeycomb lattice . The <span
class="math inline">\(\nu=0\)</span> phase is the amorphous analogue of
the abelian toric-code QSL , whereas the <span
class="math inline">\(\nu=\pm1\)</span> KSLs is a non-Abelian chiral
spin liquid (CSL). We study two specific features of the latter liquid:
topologically protected edge states and a thermal-induced Anderson
transition to a thermal metal phase .
<p>% The Kitaev spin liquids are classified by their Majorana fermion
dispersion and topological properties. On the honeycomb lattice, tuning
the exchange couplings <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span> can
change the ground state from a gapped QSL with Abelian anyonic
excitations (e.g., when <span class="math inline">\(J^z\gg
J^x,J^y\)</span>) or gapless (e.g., when <span
class="math inline">\(J^z=J^x=J^y\)</span>). In the latter case,
breaking time reversal symmetry (TRS) opens a gap that signals the onset
of a chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase supporting non-Abelian excitations
and protected edge modes. On the honeycomb lattice, CSLs are only
obtained by perturbing a Hamiltonian with, for example, magnetic fields
or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges . CSLs on the pure Kitaev model can
be obtained on <span class="math inline">\(z=3\)</span> lattices
containing odd-sided plaquettes, for which any Majorana QSL displays
spontaneous TRS breaking , as confirmed on decorated honeycomb and
non-Archimedean lattices.</p>
{} We start with a brief review of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb
lattice . Here, a spin-1/2 is placed on every vertex and each bond is
labelled by an index <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \{ x, y,
z\}\)</span>. The bonds are arranged such that each vertex connects to
exactly one bond of each type. The Hamiltonian is given by <span
class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:kitham}
    \mathcal{H} =  - \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha},
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha_j\)</span> is a Pauli matrix acting
on site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, (j,k_) is a pair of
nearest-neighbour indices connected by an <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-bond with exchange coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span>. For each plaquette of the
lattice, we can define the conserved operator $ W_p = _j^{}_k^{}$, where
the product runs clockwise over the bonds around the plaquette. This
provides an extensive number of conserved plaquettes that allow us to
split the Hilbert space in terms of the eigenvalues of <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span>.
The KSL is uncovered by transforming eqn.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:kitham}\)</span> to a four-Majorana
representation of the spin operators, <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_i^\alpha = i b_i^\alpha c_i\)</span> ,
where the Hamiltonian takes the form <span
class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\label{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}
    \mathcal{H} = \frac{i}{4}\sum_{j,k}A_{jk}^{(\alpha)}c_jc_k.
\end{equation}\]</span> Here, <span
class="math inline">\(A_{jk}^{(\alpha)}=2J^{\alpha}u_{jk}\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(\hat u_{jk} =
ib_j^{\alpha}b_k^{\alpha}\)</span> being conserved <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z_2\)</span> bond operators. Once the
<span class="math inline">\(\hat u_{jk}\)</span> eigenvalues are fixed,
the Kitaev model becomes equivalent to a fermionic problem that can be
diagonalized with standard methods .
The Kitaev Hamiltonian remains exactly solvable on any graph in which no
site connects to more than one bond of the same type . Thus, we are
restricted to lattices in which every vertex has coordination number
<span class="math inline">\(z \leq 3\)</span>. Here, such graphs are
generated with Voronoi tessellation . A set of points are sampled
uniformly from the unit square and cells are generated as the region of
space closer to a given point than any other. The lattice is given by
the boundaries between cells with edges at the interface of two cells
and vertices at the point where three edges meet. Periodic boundary
conditions are imposed by tiling the initial set of points and then
connecting corresponding edges that cross the unit square boundaries -
see for technical details. One example of such an amorphous lattice is
shown in~(a).
Once a random network has been generated, the bonds types must be
assigned in a way that is consistent with our condition, which we refer
to as a . The problem of finding such a colouring was shown to be
equivalent to the classical problem of four-colouring the faces, which
is always solvable in planar graphs~. On the torus, a face colouring can
require up to seven colours , and so not all graphs can be assumed to be
3-edge colourable. However, such exceptions are rare – every graph
generated in this study admitted multiple distinct 3-edge colourings.
The problem of finding a colouring for a given graph can be reduced to a
Boolean satisfiability problem , which we then solve using the
open-source solver ~.
<p>Once the three-edge colouring has been found, the Kitaev Hamiltonian
is mapped onto eqn.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}\)</span>, which
corresponds to the spin fractionalization in terms of a static <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z_2\)</span> gauge fields and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> matter as indicated in ~(b) . Strictly
speaking, the Majorana system is equivalent to the original spin system
after applying a projector operator , whose form is presented in .
Despite this caveat, one can still use eqn.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}\)</span> to
evaluate the expectation values of operators conserving <span
class="math inline">\(\hat u_{jk}\)</span> in the thermodynamic limit .
This type of operator is exemplified by the Hamiltonian itself, for
which the ground state energy of a fixed sector is the sum of the
negative eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(iA/4\)</span> in
eqn.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}\)</span>, and whose
excitations are extracted from the positive eigenvalues of the same
matrix.</p>
{} Let us now consider the conserved operators $ W_p = _j^{}_k^{}$ on
amorphous lattices. When represented in the Majorana Hilbert space,
these operators correspond to ordered products of <span
class="math inline">\(\hat u_{jk}\)</span>, and their fixed eigenvalues
are written as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:flux_definition}
    \phi_p = \prod_{(j,k) \in \partial p} (-iu_{jk}),
\end{equation}\]</span> where the pairs <span
class="math inline">\(j,k\)</span> are crossed around the border <span
class="math inline">\(\partial p\)</span> of the plaquette on the
orientation. In periodic boundaries there is an additional pair of
global <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span> fluxes <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_y\)</span>, which are calculated along an
arbitrary closed path that wraps the torus in the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> directions respectively. The energy
difference between distinct flux sectors decays exponentially with
system size, so that the ground state of any flux sector in the
thermodynamic limit displays a fourfold topological degeneracy .
We now need to determine the ground state flux sectors. First, let us
recall that Majorana QSLs emerging on graphs containing odd-sided
plaquette undergo a spontaneous TRS breaking . Therefore, there will be
always a twofold ground state degeneracy due to time-reversal, in which
one ground state is related to the other by inversion of imaginary <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_p\)</span> fluxes . An insight pointing to
the ground state sectors come from the model on the honeycomb lattice,
for which a theorem proved by Lieb sets that the ground state sector to
be <span class="math inline">\(\phi_p=+1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\forall p\)</span> . Although Lieb’s theorem is
not extendable to amorphous lattices, it is suggested the ground state
energy for a sufficiently large system is minimised by setting <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align} \label{eqn:gnd_flux}
    \phi_p^{\textup{g.s.}} = -(\pm i)^{n_{\textup{sides}}},
\end{align}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n_{\textup{sides}}\)</span> is the number of edges
that form <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the global choice
of the sign of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> gives each of the
two TRS-degenerate ground state flux sectors. Such a conjecture is
consistent with Lieb’s theorem on regular lattices and is supported by
numerical evidence as detailed in . Once we have identified the ground
state, any other sector can be characterized by the configuration of
vortices, i.e. by the plaquettes whose flux is flipped with respect to
<span
class="math inline">\(\left\{\phi_p^{\textup{g.s.}}\right\}\)</span>.
{} We numerically found that the amorphous KSLs are generally gapped,
except along the critical lines displayed in <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:example_lattice}\)</span>(c). The QSLs
separated by these lines are distinguished by a real-space analogue of
the Chern number . A similar topological number was discussed by Kitaev
on the honeycomb lattice that we shall use here with a slight
modification . For a choice of flux sector, we calculate the projector
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> onto the negative energy
eigenstates of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(iA\)</span>
defined in eqn.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:majorana_hamiltonian}\)</span>. The local
Chern number around a point <span class="math inline">\(\bf R\)</span>
in the bulk is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    \nu (\bf R) = 4\pi \Im \Tr_{\textup{Bulk}}
    \left (
    P\theta_{R_x} P \theta_{R_y} P
    \right ),
\end{align}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_{R_x}\)</span> is a step function in the
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-direction, with the step located
at <span class="math inline">\(x = R_x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_{R_y}\)</span> is defined analogously. The
trace is taken over a region around <span class="math inline">\(\bf
R\)</span> in the bulk of the material, where care must be taken not to
include any points close to the edges. Provided that the point <span
class="math inline">\(\bf R\)</span> is sufficiently far from the edges,
this quantity will be very close to quantised to the Chern number.
The local Chern marker distinguishes between an Abelian phase (A) with
<span class="math inline">\(\nu = 0\)</span>, and a non-Abelian (B)
phase characterized by <span class="math inline">\(\nu = \pm 1\)</span>.
The (A) phase is equivalent to the toric code on an amorphous system . {
Since the (A) phase displays the “topological” degeneracy described
above, I think that “topologically trivial” is not a good term to
describe it. Another thing that I think it should be considered here.
The abelian phase is expected to have 2x4 degeneracy, where the factor
of 2 comes from time-reversal. On the other hand, the non-Abelian phase
should display 2x3 degeneracy, as discussed by . Did you get any
evidence of this?}
By contrast, the (B) phase is a , the magnetic analogue of the
fractional quantum Hall state. Topologically protected edge modes are
predicted to occur in these states on periodic boundary conditions
following the bulk-boundary correspondence . The probability density of
one such edge mode is given in (a), where it is shown to be
exponentially localised to the boundary of the system. The localization
of these modes can be quantified by their inverse participation ratio
(IPR), <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    \textup{IPR} = \int d^2r|\psi(\mathbf{r})|^4  \propto L^{-\tau},
\end{equation}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(L\sim\sqrt{N}\)</span> is the characteristic
linear dimension of the amorphous lattices and <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> dimensional scaling exponent of IPR.
Finally, the CSL density of states in open boundary conditions indicates
the low-energy modes within the gap of Majorana bands in (b). { Could
you plot the dimensional scaling exponent <span
class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> in (a)?}
<p>The phase diagram of the amorphous model in <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:example_lattice}\)</span>(c) displays a
reduced parameter space for the non-Abelian phase when compared to the
honeycomb model. Interestingly, similar inward deformations of the
critical lines were found on the Kitaev honeycomb model subject to
disorder by proliferating flux vortices or exchange disorder .</p>
{} An Ising non-Abelian anyon is formed by Majorana zero-modes bound to
a topological defect . Interactions between anyons are modeled by
pairwise projectors whose strength absolute value decays exponentially
with the separation between the particles, and whose sign oscillates in
analogy to RKKY exchanges . Disorder can induce a finite density of
anyons whose hybridization lead to a macroscopically degenerate state
known as . One instance of this phase can be settled on the Kitaev CSL.
In this case, the topological defects correspond to the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p \neq +1\)</span> fluxes, which naturally
emerge from thermal fluctuations at nonzero temperature .
We demonstrated that the amorphous CSL undergoes the same form of
Anderson transition by studying its properties as a function of
disorder. Unfortunately, we could not perform a complete study of its
properties as a function of the temperature as it was not feasible to
evaluate an ever-present boundary condition dependent factor for random
networks. Instead, we evaluated the fermionic density of states (DOS)
and the IPR as a function of the vortex density <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> as a proxy for temperature. This
approximation is exact in the limits <span class="math inline">\(T =
0\)</span> (corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\rho =
0\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(T \to \infty\)</span>
(corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0.5\)</span>). At
intermediate temperatures the method neglects to include the influence
of defect-defect correlations. However, such an approximation is enough
to show the onset of low-energy excitations for <span
class="math inline">\(\rho \sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}\)</span>, as displayed
on the top graphic of <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:DOS_Oscillations}\)</span>(a). We
characterized these gapless excitations using the dimensional scaling
exponential <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> of the IPR on the
bottom graphic of the same figure. At small <span
class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, the states populating the gap
possess <span class="math inline">\(\tau\approx0\)</span>, indicating
that they are localised states pinned to the defects, and the system
remains insulating. At large <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>,
the in-gap states merge with the bulk band and become extensive, closing
the gap, and the system transitions to a metallic phase. { Maybe being a
bit more quantitative about <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>
can enrich the discussion by allowing us to discuss a bit about the
multifractality of these low-energy states}
The thermal metal DOS displays a logarithmic divergence at zero energy
and characteristic oscillations at small energies. . These features were
indeed observed by the averaged density of states in the <span
class="math inline">\(\rho = 0.5\)</span> case shown in (b) for
amorphous lattice. We emphasize that the CSL studied here emerges
without an applied magnetic field as opposed to the CSL on the honeycomb
lattice studied in Ref. { I have the impression that (b) on the top is
very similar to Fig. 3 of . Maybe a more instructive figure would be the
DOS of the amorphous toric code at the infinite temperature limit. In
this case, the lack of non-Abelian anyons would be reflected by a gap on
the DOS, which would contrast nicely to the thermal metal phase}
<p>% This high temperature phase of the amorphous model is known as a
thermal metal. The signature of the thermal metal phase is
characteristic oscillations in the low energy density of states, as seen
in~(b).</p>
{} We have studied an extension of the Kitaev honeycomb model to
amorphous lattices with coordination number <span
class="math inline">\(z= 3\)</span>. We found that it is able to support
two quantum spin liquid phases that can be distinguished using a
real-space generalisation of the Chern number. The presence of odd-sided
plaquettes on these lattices let to a spontaneous breaking of time
reversal symmetry, leading to the emergence of a chiral spin liquid
phase. Furthermore we found evidence that the amorphous system undergoes
an Anderson transition to a thermal metal phase, driven by the
proliferation of vortices with increasing temperature. The next step is
to search for an experimental realisation in amorphous Kitaev materials,
which can be created from crystalline ones using several methods .
Following the evidence for an induced chiral spin liquid phase in
crystalline Kitaev materials , it would be interesting to investigate if
a similar state is produced on its amorphous counterpart. Besides the
usual half-quantized signature on thermal Hall effect , such a CSL could
be also characterized using local probes such as spin-polarized
scanning-tunneling microscopy . The same probes would also be useful to
manipulate non-Abelian anyons , thereby implementing elementary
operations for topological quantum computation. Finally, the thermal
metal phase can be diagnosed using bulk heat transport measurements .
<p>This work can be generalized in several ways. Introduction of
symmetry allowed perturbations on the model . Generalizations to
higher-spin models in random networks with different coordination
numbers </p>
<p>% In the present work, we have avoided the need for a rigorous Monte
Carlo study of the thermal phase transition. As a consequence, the
thermodynamic nature of the transition between the chiral QSL and
thermal metal states has not been elucidated. { insert some guff about
the Imri-Ma argument}.</p>
<p>{ Probably one way to make this theory experimentally relevant is to
do experiments on amorphous phases of Kitaev materials. These phases can
be obtained by liquifying the material and cooling it fast. Apparently,
most of crystalline magnets can be transformed into amorphous ones
through this process. } %Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising
candidate for realising Kitaev physics in an amorphous system. Yamada et
al. propose a realisation of the Kitaev honeycomb model in a crystalline
Ru-oxalate MOF~, and Misumi et al.~have demonstrated potential
signatures of a resonating valence bond quantum spin liquid state in
MOFs with Kagome geometry~. Amorphous MOFs can be generated by
introducing disorder into crystalline MOFs through mechanical
processes~, suggesting a natural route to realising amorphous Kitaev
physics. Assuming it is possible to realise Kitaev physics in a
crystalline MOF, it is unclear what superexchange couplings would be
retained when disorder is introduced to the lattice. Because it is
unlikely one would cleanly reproduce the exact model described in the
present work, future work should examine how robust the CSL ground state
of the amorphous Kitaev model is to additional disorder in the
Hamiltonian, for example random recoloring of the bonds, additional bond
forming and breaking, and disorder in coupling strengths.</p>

%
<p>% The Kitaev honeycomb lattice model (HLM) is composed of spin-()
particles interacting anisotropically along the edges of a lattice: %
\begin{equation} % =
-<em>{(i,j)}J^{</em>{ij}}<em>i^{</em>{ij}}<em>j^{</em>{ij}} +

term runs over pairs of nearest neighbours and the three spin term runs
over consecutive triplets around a plaquette. The Pauli matrices <span

according to the type, or
<code>coloring', of the bond $i\to j$, $\alpha_{ij}\in\{x,y,z\}$. The bond coloring is chosen such that exactly one bond of each type is connected to each vertex. % This Hamiltonian is exactly solvable by introducing a Majorana representation \(\widetilde{\sigma}_i^{\alpha} = i b^{\alpha}_i c_i\) which the partitions the Hilbert space into a classical $\mathrm{Z}_2$ gauge degree of freedom, \(u_{jk} = ib_j^{\alpha_{jk}}b_k^{\alpha_{jk}}\), on the bonds, and Majorana fermions, $c_j$, living on the vertices. It also doubles the size of the Fock space, necessitating calculating a projector \(P\) from the Majorana Fock space \(\mathcal{\widetilde{M}}\) onto the physical subspace \(\mathcal{M}\)~\cite{pedrocchiPhysicalSolutionsKitaev2011}. We refer to a choice of gauge configuration, $\{u_{jk}\}$, as the</code>flux
sector’. The problem then reduces to solving a free-fermion Hamiltonian

% (b^{’}_1, b^{’’}_1, … ;b^{’}_N, b^{’‘}<em>N) = (c_1, c_2, …
;c</em>{2N}) Q % \end{equation} % from which we create the fermionic
operators (a_i = (b^{’}_i + ib^{’’}_i)), bringing (H) to the form %
\begin{equation} % ^u = _m _m (n_m - ) % \end{equation} % with ground
state energy (E_0 = -_m <em>m). The projector has the effect of removing
many body states with either even or odd parity (= <em>i (1 - 2n_i)), an
effect which typically leads to a correction of order (). The gauge
symmetries of <span class="math inline">\(\{u_{jk}\}\)</span> can be
removed by defining plaquette operators (P_i = </em>{(i,j) P_i}
u</em>{ij}) that wind the plaquettes (faces) of the lattice.</p>
<p>% The ground state flux sector of the HLM in the isotropic phase
(<span class="math inline">\(J^x = J^y = J^z\)</span>) at zero field
(<span class="math inline">\(\kappa=0\)</span>) possesses a gapless
fermionic spectrum. A non-zero field (<span
class="math inline">\(\kappa\neq0\)</span>) opens a gap, and the
resulting fermionic insulator is known to host non-Abelian anyonic
excitations and possess a non-zero Chern number~. This non-abelian phase
has been shown to undergo a finite-temperature phase transition to a
so-called `thermal metal’ phase, which exhibits multifractility~.</p>
<p>For a lattice with (B) bonds, (V) vertices, (P) plaquettes and Euler
characteristic () (0 for the torus) the Euler equation states that (B =
P + V + ). This corresponds to the (2^{B}) gauge configurations being
composed of (2^{P - 1}) physically distinct vortex states each of which
is composed of (2^{V - 1}) gauge equivalent states that correspond to
flipping three (u_{ij}) around a vertex, along with (2 - )
non-contractible loop operators. The term (2 - ) is perhaps more easily
understood by relating () to the genus of the surface (g), i.e the
number of holes with (= 2 - 2g) showing that there are two
non-contractible loops for each hole in the surface.</p>
<p>Care must be taken in the definition of open boundary conditions,
simply removing bonds from the lattice leaves behind unpaired (b^)
operators that need to be paired in some way to arrive at fermionic
modes. In order to fix a pairing we always start from a lattice defined
on the torus and generate a lattice with open boundary conditions by
defining the bond coupling (J^{}_{ij} = 0) for sites joined by bonds
((i,j)) that we want to remove. This creates fermionic zero modes (u_ij)
associated with these cut bonds which we set to 1 when calculating the
projector.</p>
<p>{ Add brief mention of fermions and many body ground state} Closely
following the derivation of~ we can extend to the amorphous case
relatively simply. The main quantity needed is the product of the local
projectors (D_i) [_i^{2N} D_i = _i^{2N} b^x_i b^y_i b^z_i c_i ] for a
lattice with (2N) vertices and (3N) edges. The operators can be ordered
by bond type without utilising any property of the lattice. [_i^{2N} D_i
= _i^{2N} b^x_i _i^{2N} b^y_i _i^{2N} b^z_i _i^{2N} c_i] The product
over (c_i) operators reduces to a determinant of the Q matrix and the
fermion parity. The only problem is to compute the factors (p_x,p_y,p_z
= ) that arise from reordering the b operators such that pairs of
vertices linked by the corresponding bonds are adjacent. [<em>i^{2N}
b^<em>i = p</em></em>{(i,j)}b^_i b^_j] This is simple the parity of the
permutation from one ordering to the other and can be computed easily
with a cycle decomposition.</p>
<p>The final form is almost identical to the honeycomb case with the
addition of the lattice structure factors (p_x,p_y,p_z) [P^0 = 1 +
p_x;p_y;p_z (Q^u) ; ; <em>{{i,j}} -iu</em>{ij}]</p>
<p>((Q^u)) is the determinant of the matrix that takes ((c_1, c_2…
c_{2N}) Q = (b_1, b_2… b_{2N})). This along with (u_{ij}) depend on the
lattice and the particular vortex sector.</p>
<p>( = ^{N} (1 - 2_i)) is the parity of the particular many body state
determined by fermionic occupation numbers (n_i). The Hamiltonian is (H
= _i (n_i - 1/2)) in this basis and this tells use that the ground state
is either an empty system with all (n_i = 0) or a state with a single
fermion in the lowest level.</p>
In this section we detail the numerical evidence collected to support
the claim that, for an arbitrary lattice, a gapped ground state flux
sector is found by setting the flux through each plaquette to <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_{\textup{g.s.}} = -(\pm
i)^{n_{\textup{sides}}}\)</span>. This was done by generating a large
number (<span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> 25,000) of lattices
and exhaustively checking every possible flux sector to find the
configuration with the lowest energy. We checked both the isotropic
point (<span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha = 1\)</span>), as well as in
the toric code phase (<span class="math inline">\(J^x = J^y = 0.25, J^z
= 1\)</span>).
The argument has one complication: for a graph with <span
class="math inline">\(n_p\)</span> plaquettes, there are <span
class="math inline">\(2^{n_p - 1}\)</span> distinct flux sectors to
search over, with an added factor of 4 when the global fluxes <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_y\)</span> are taken into account. Note that
the <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> appears in this counting
because fluxes can only be flipped in pairs. To be able to search over
the entire flux space, one is necessarily restricted to looking at small
system sizes – we were able to check all flux sectors for systems with
<span class="math inline">\(n_p \leq 16\)</span> in a reasonable amount
of time. However, at such small system size we find that finite size
effects are substantial enough to destroy our results. In order to
overcome these effects we tile the system and use Bloch’s theorem (a
trick that we shall refer to as for reasons that shall become clear) to
efficiently find the energy of a much larger (but periodic) lattice.
Thus we are able to suppress finite size effects, at the expense of
losing long-range disorder in the lattice.
<p>Our argument has three parts: First we shall detail the techniques
used to exhaustively search the flux space for a given lattice. Next, we
discuss finite-size effects and explain the way that our methods are
modified by the twist-averaging procedure. Finally, we demonstrate that
as the size of the disordered system is increased, the effect of
twist-averaging becomes negligible – suggesting that our conclusions
still apply in the case of large disordered lattices.</p>
{} For a given lattice and flux sector, defined by <span
class="math inline">\(\{ u_{jk}\}\)</span>, the fermionic ground state
energy is calculated by taking the sum of the negative eigenvalues of
the matrix <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    M_{jk} = \frac{i}{2} J^{\alpha} u_{jk}.
\end{align}\]</span> The set of bond variables <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span>, which we are free to choose,
determine the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z_2\)</span> gauge
field. However only the fluxes, defined for each plaquette according to
eqn.~<span class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:flux_definition}\)</span>,
have any effect on the energies. Thus, there is enormous degeneracy in
the <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> degrees of freedom.
Flipping the bonds along any closed loop on the dual lattice has no
effect on the fluxes, since each plaquette has had an even number of its
constituent bonds flipped - as is shown in the following diagram:
where the flipped bonds are shown in red. In order to explore every
possible flux sector using the <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> variables, we restrict ourselves
to change only a subset of the bonds in the system. In particular, we
construct a spanning tree on the dual lattice, which passes through
every plaquette in the system, but contains no loops.
<p>The tree contains <span class="math inline">\(n_p - 1\)</span> edges,
shown in red, whose configuration space has a <span
class="math inline">\(1:1\)</span> mapping onto the <span
class="math inline">\(2^{n_p - 1}\)</span> distinct flux sectors. Each
flux sector can be created in precisely one way by flipping edges only
on the tree (provided all other bond variables not on the tree remain
fixed). Thus, all possible flux sectors can be accessed by iterating
over all configurations of edges on this spanning tree.</p>
{} In our numerical investigation, the objective was to test as many
example lattices as possible. We aim for the largest lattice size that
could be efficiently solved, requiring a balance between lattice size
and cases tested. Each added plaquette doubles the number of flux
sectors that must be checked. 25,000 lattices containing 16 plaquettes
were used. However, in his numerical investigation of the honeycomb
model, Kitaev demonstrated that finite size effects persist up to much
larger lattice sizes than we were able to access .
In order to circumvent this problem, we treat the 16-plaquette amorphous
lattice as a unit cell in an arbitrarily large periodic system. The
bonds that originally connected across the periodic boundaries now
connect adjacent unit cells. This infinite periodic Hamiltonian can then
be solved using Bloch’s theorem, since the larger system is diagonalised
by a plane wave ansatz. For a given crystal momentum $\bf q<span
class="math inline">\(. We then check if the lowest energy flux sector
aligns with our ansatz (eqn.~\ref{eqn:gnd_flux}) and whether this flux
sector is gapped. \par In the isotropic case (\)</span>J^= 1<span
class="math inline">\(), all 25,000 examples conformed to our guess for
the ground state flux sector. A tiny minority (\)</span>10$) of the
systems were found to be gapless. As we shall see shortly, the
proportion of gapless systems vanishes as we increase the size of the
amorphous lattice. An example of the energies and gaps for one of the
systems tested is shown in fig.~<span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:energy_gaps_example}\)</span>. For the
anisotropic phase (we used $ J^x, J^y = 0.25, J^z = 1<span
class="math inline">\() the overwhelming majority of cases adhered to
our ansatz, however a small minority (\)</span>0.5 %$) did not. In these
cases, however, the energy difference between our ansatz and the ground
state was at most of order <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\)</span>.
Further investigation would need to be undertaken to determine whether
these anomalous systems are a finite size effect due to the small
amorphous system sizes used or a genuine feature of the toric code phase
on such lattices.
<p>{} Now that we have collected sufficient evidence to support our
guess for the ground state flux sector, we turn our attention to
checking that this sector is gapped. We no longer need to exhaustively
search over flux space for the ground state, so it is possible to go to
much larger system size. We generate 40 sets of systems with plaquette
numbers ranging from 9 to 1600. For each system size, 1000 distinct
lattices are generated and the energy and gap size are calculated
without phase twisting, since the effect is negligible for such large
system sizes. As can be seen, for very small system size a small
minority of gapless systems appear, however beyond around 20 plaquettes
all systems had a stable fermion gap in the ground state.</p>
% Thus, we shall begin with a discussion of how finite size affects the
eigenvalues of the Majorana Hamiltonian, followed by our solution to
this problem. Evidence for the ground state solution was collected by
searching over all possible flux sectors for the lowest energy states.
This is repeated for various values of <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span> over a large number of randomly
generated lattices.
<p>% For a given lattice and flux sector, defined by <span
class="math inline">\(\{ u_{jk}\}\)</span>, the fermionic ground state
energy is found by taking the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the
matrix % \begin{align} % M_{jk} = J^{} u_{jk}. % \end{align} % A gauge
transformation involves flipping the value of <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> for the three bonds connected to
the point at <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Under a gauge
transformation, the matrix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
transforms according to <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow D_j M
D_j\)</span>, where the matrix <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
is a diagonal matrix with <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> on the
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’th entry, and <span
class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> on all others. This represents a
unitary transformation, so the spectrum of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is invariant under gauge
transformations. As demonstrated in , the spectrum is determined
entirely by the flux through all circuits in the system, which we define
analogously to <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{eqn:flux_definition}\)</span>. In this case
we include not only plaquettes, but circuits that encircle several
plaquettes. In periodic boundaries we must also consider</p>
% In the language of graph theory, this matrix may be interpreted as
representing a weighted, directed digraph, with weights determined by
the individual entries of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The
Harary-Sachs theorem states that the characteristic polynomial of such a
matrix may be written in terms of the weights of the cycles of the
graph, defined as the product of the elements of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> around some closed path <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal C\)</span> on the lattice, %
\begin{align} % w_{} = <em>{} M</em>{jk}. % \end{align} % These weights
are similar to the fluxes defined in the bulk text, with two important
differences. Firstly, the cyclic weights include the factor of <span
class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span> in the product. Secondly, unlike
tthe fluxes, which are defined for individual plaquettes, the weights
are calculated for every closed path on the lattice. The takeaway is
that the characteristic polynomial, and thus all eigenvalues, is
determined only by the values of these weights. Any change to the set of
<span class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> that does not affect the
weight of any cycles will have no effect on the energies of the system.
For example a gauge transformation, where <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> is flipped on the three edges
connected to a chosen site, cannot affect the energies, as every cycle
passing through the chosen site must contain two of the flipped edges.
