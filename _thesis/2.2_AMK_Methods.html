<p>The practical implemntation of what is described in this section is
available as a Python package called Koala (Kitaev On Amorphous
LAttices)<span class="citation"

<h2 id="voronisation">Voronisation</h2>
<p>In order to study the properties of the amorphous Kitaev model we
need a way to sample from the space of possible trivalent graphs.</p>
<p>A very simple way to do this is to use a Voronoi partition of the
torus<span class="citation"
data-cites="mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018 marsalTopologicalWeaireThorpeModels2020 florescu_designer_2009"><sup><a
href="#ref-mitchellAmorphousTopologicalInsulators2018"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a>–<a href="#ref-florescu_designer_2009"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. We start by sampling <em>seed
points</em> uniformly (or otherwise) on the torus. We then compute the
partition of the torus into regions closest (with a Euclidean metric) to
each seed point. The straight lines (if the torus is flattened out) at
the borders of these regions become the edges of the new lattice and the
points where they intersect beceme the vertices.</p>
<p>The graph generated by a Voronoi partition of a two dimensional
surface is always planar meaning that no edges cross eachother when the
graph is embedded into the plane. It is also trivalent in the sense that
every vertex is connected to exactly three edges
<strong>cite</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideally we might instead sample uniformly from the space of possible
trivalent graphs, and indeed there has been some work on how to do this
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach<span class="citation"
data-cites="alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016"><sup><a
href="#ref-alyamiUniformSamplingDirected2016"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>, however it does not gurantee
that the resulting graph is planar which we will need to ensure that the
edges can be 3-coloured.</p>
<p>In practice, we then use a standard algorithm<span class="citation"
data-cites="barberQuickhullAlgorithmConvex1996"><sup><a
href="#ref-barberQuickhullAlgorithmConvex1996"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> from scipy<span class="citation"
data-cites="virtanenSciPyFundamentalAlgorithms2020a"><sup><a
href="#ref-virtanenSciPyFundamentalAlgorithms2020a"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> which actually computes the
Voronoi partition of the plane. In order to compute the Voronoi
partition of the torus, I take the seed points and replicate them into a
repeating grid, either 3x3 (or for very small numbers of seed points
5x5). I then identify edges in the output to construct a lattice on the
torus.</p>

<h2 id="graph-representation">Graph Representation</h2>
<p>There are three keys pieces of information that we use to represent
amorphous lattices.</p>
<p>Most of the graph connectivity is encoded by an ordered list of edges
<span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>. These are ordered so that we
can represent both directed and undirected graphs which is useful for
defining the sign of bond operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} =
- u_{ji}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Information about the embedding of the lattice onto the torus is
encoded into a point on the unit square associated with each vertex. The
torus is unwrapped onto the square by defining an arbitary pair of cuts
along the major and minor axes which for simplicity we take to be the
lines <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>. We can wrap the unit square back
up into a torus by identifying the lines <span class="math inline">\(x =
0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(y
= 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need a way to encode the topology of the graph. We need
this because given simply an edge <span class="math inline">\((i,
j)\)</span> we do not know how the edge gets from vertex i to vertex j.
It could do so by taking the shortest path but it could also ‘go the
long way around’ by crossing one of the cuts. To encode this information
we store an additional vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> associated with each edge. <span
class="math inline">\(r_i^x = 0\)</span> means that edge i does not
cross the x while <span class="math inline">\(r_i^x = +1\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>) means it crossed the cut in a
positive (negative) sense.</p>
<p>This description of the lattice has a very nice relationship to
Bloch’s theorem. When you apply Bloch’s theorem to a periodic lattice
you essentially wrap the unit cell onto a torus. Variations that happen
at longer length scales than the size of the unit cell are captured by
the crystal momentum which inserts a phase factor <span
class="math inline">\(e^{i \vec{q}\cdot\vec{r}}\)</span> onto bonds that
cross to adjacent unit cells. The vector <span
class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> is exactly what we use to encode
the topology of our lattices.</p>

<h2 id="coloring-the-bonds">Coloring the Bonds</h2>
<p>The Kitaev model requires that each edge in the lattice be assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that each vertex has exactly one
edge of each type connected to it. Let <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> be the maximum degree of a graph
which in our case is 3. If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta &gt;
3\)</span> it is obviously not possible to 3 color the edges but the
general theory of when this is and isn’t possible for graphs with <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta \leq 3\)</span> is more subtle.</p>
<p>In the graph theory literature, graphs where all vertices have degree
3 are commonly called cubic graphs, there is no term for graphs with
maximum degree 3. Planar graphs are those that can be embedded onto the
plane without any edges crossing. Bridgeless graphs do not contain any
edges that, when removed, would partition the graph into disconnected
components.</p>
<p>It’s important to be clear that this problem is different from that
considered by the famous 4 color theorem<span class="citation"
data-cites="appelEveryPlanarMap1989"><sup><a
href="#ref-appelEveryPlanarMap1989"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span> . The 4 color thorem is
concerned with assiging colours to the <strong>vertices</strong> of a
graph such that no vertices that share an edge are the same colour. Here
we are concerned with an edge colouring.</p>
<p>The four color theorem applies to planar graphs, those that can be
embedded onto the plane without any edges crossing. Here we are actually
concerned with Toroidal graphs which can be embedded onto the torus
without any edges crossing. In fact toroidal graphs require up to 7
colors<span class="citation"
data-cites="heawoodMapColouringTheorems"><sup><a
href="#ref-heawoodMapColouringTheorems"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span> . The complete graph <span
class="math inline">\(K_7\)</span> is a good example of a toroidal graph
that requires 7 colours.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\Delta + 1\)</span> colours are enough to
edge-colour any graph and there is an <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(mn)\)</span> algorithm to do it for a
graph with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices<span class="citation"
data-cites="gEstimateChromaticClass1964"><sup><a
href="#ref-gEstimateChromaticClass1964"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>. Restricting ourselves to
graphs with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = 3\)</span> like ours,
those can be 4-edge-coloured in linear time<span class="citation"

href="#ref-skulrattanakulchai4edgecoloringGraphsMaximum2002"
role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span> .</p>
<p>It’s trickier if we want to 3-edge-colour them however. Cubic, planar
bridgeless graphs can be 3-edge-coloured if and only if they can be
4-face-coloured<span class="citation"
data-cites="tait1880remarks"><sup><a href="#ref-tait1880remarks"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> . For which there is an <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\)</span> algorithm
robertson1996efficiently . However it is not clear whether this extends
to cubic, <strong>toroidal</strong> bridgeless graphs.</p>
<h3 id="four-colourings-and-three-colourings">Four-colourings and
three-colourings</h3>
<p>The proof of that 4-face-colourablity implies 3-edge-colourability
can be sketched out quite easily: 1. Assume the faces of G can be
4-coloured with labels (0,1,2,3) 2. Label each edge of G according to
<span class="math inline">\(i + j \mathrm{mod} 3\)</span> where i and j
are the labels of the face adjacent to that edge. For each edge label
there are two face label pairs that do not share any face labels. i,e
the edge label <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> can come about
either from faces <span class="math inline">\(0 + 3\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(1 + 2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
0 + 3 \;\mathrm{or}\; 1 + 2 &amp;= 0 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
0 + 1 \;\mathrm{or}\; 2 + 3 &amp;= 1 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
0 + 2 \;\mathrm{or}\;1 + 3 &amp;= 2 \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In a cubic planar G, a vertex v in G is always part of 3 faces and
the colors of those faces determines the colors of the edges that
connect to v. The three faces must take three distinct colors from
(0,1,2,3).</li>
<li>From there’s easy to convince yourself that those three distinct
face colours can never produce repeated edge colours according to the
<span class="math inline">\(i+j \;\mathrm{mod}\; 3\)</span> rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>This implies that all cubic planar graphs are 3-edge-colourable. It
does not apply to toroidcal graphs, however I have not yet generated a
voronoi lattices on the torus that is not 3-edge-colourable. This
suggests that perhaps voronoi lattices have additional structure that
makes them 3-edge-colourable. Intuitively, the kinds of toroidal graphs
that cannot be 3-edge-coloured look as if they could never be generated
by a voronoi partition with more than a few seed points.</p>
<h3 id="finding-lattice-colourings-in-practice-unfinished">Finding
Lattice colourings in practice (unfinished)</h3>
<p>Some things are harder in theory than in practice. 3-edge-colouring
cubic toroidal graphs appears to be one of those things.</p>
<p>The approach I take is relatively standard in the computer science
community for solving NP problems computationally. I don’t believe this
problem to be in NP but I tried it anyway.</p>
<p>The trick is to map the problem on into a Boolean Satisfiability
‘SAT’ problem<span class="citation" data-cites="Karp1972"><sup><a
href="#ref-Karp1972" role="doc-biblioref">13</a></sup></span>, use an
off the shelf solver, <code>MiniSAT</code><span class="citation"
data-cites="imms-sat18"><sup><a href="#ref-imms-sat18"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span>, and finally to map the problem
back to the original domain. While SAT solvers are very general, they
are also highly optimised and they do seem to yield good results for
this problem.</p>
<p>SAT solvers encode problems as constraints on some number of boolean
variables <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in {0,1}\)</span>. The
constraints must Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). CNF means the
constraints are encoded as a set of clauses of the form <span
class="math display">\[x_1 \;\textrm{or}\; \bar{x}_3 \;\textrm{or}\;
x_5\]</span> that containt logical ORs of some subset of the variables
where any of the variables may also be logical NOT’d which I represent
by over bars here.</p>
<p>A solution of the problem is one that makes all the clauses
simultaneously true.</p>
<p>I encode the edge colouring problem as a set of statements about a
set of boolean variables <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in
{0,1}\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> bonds we take
the <span class="math inline">\(3B\)</span> variables <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i\alpha}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i\alpha} = 1\)</span> indicates that edge <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has colour <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>For edge colouring graphs we need two kinds of constraints: 1. Each
edge is exactly one colour. 2. No neighbouring edges are the same
color.</p>
<p>The first constraint is a kind of artifact of doing this mapping over
to boolean variables, the solver doesn’t know anything about the
structure of the problem unless it is encoded into the variables.</p>
<p>The second constraint encodes the structure of the graph itself and
can be constructed easily from the adjacency matrix.</p>
<p>I’ll fill in the encoding later but the gist is that we can give this
to a solver and get back: whether the problem is solveable, a solution
or all the possible solutions. Finding a solution is relatively fast,
while finding all the solutions is slower since there appear to be
exponentially many of them. Fig <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:multiple_colourings}\)</span> shows some
examples.</p>

<h3 id="does-it-matter-which-colouring-we-choose">Does it matter which
colouring we choose?</h3>
<p>In the isotropic case <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha =
1\)</span> it is easy to show that it can’t possibly make a difference.
As the choice of how we define the four Majoranas at a site is arbitrary
we can define a local operator that tranforms the colouring of any
particular site to another permutation. The operators commute with the
Hamiltonian and by composing such operators we can tranform the
Hamiltonian generated by one colouring into that generated by
another.</p>
<p>We can’t do this in the anisotropic case however, and it remains an
open question whether particular physical properties could arise by
engineering the colouring in this phase.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-between-flux-sectors-and-bond-sectors">Mapping between
flux sectors and bond sectors</h2>
<p>Constructing the Majorana representation of the model requires the
particular bond configuration <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk} = \pm
1\)</span>. However the large number of gauge symmetries of the bond
sector make it unwieldly to work with. We therefore need a way to
quickly map between bond sectors and flux sectors.</p>
<p>Going from the bond sector to flux sector is easy since we can
compute it directly by taking the product of <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{jk}\)</span> around each plaquette <span
class="math display">\[ \phi_i = \prod_{(j,k) \; \in \; \partial \phi_i}
i u_{jk}\]</span></p>
<p>Going from flux sector to bond sector requires more thought however.
The algorithm I use is this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Fix the gauge by choosing some arbitrary <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> configuration. In practice I use
<span class="math inline">\(u_{jk} = +1\)</span>. This chooses an
arbitrary one of the 4 topological sectors.</p></li>

<h2 id="chern-markers">Chern Markers</h2>
<p>We know that the standard Kitaev model supports both Abelian and
non-Abelian phases, so how can we assess whether this is also the case
for the amorphous Kitaev model?</p>
<p>We have already discussed the fact that topology and anyonic
statistics are intimately linked and this will help here. The Chern
number is a quantity that measured the topological characteristics of a
material.</p>
<p>The original definition of the Chern number relies on the model
having translation symmetry. This lead to the development of <em>local
markers</em>, these are operators defined locally that generalise the
notion of the chern number to a local observable over some region
smaller than the entire system.</p>
