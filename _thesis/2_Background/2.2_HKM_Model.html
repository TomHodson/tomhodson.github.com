<h2>The Spin Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>This section introduces the Kitaev honeycomb (KH) model. The KH model is an exactly solvable model of interacting spin<span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span> spins on the vertices of a honeycomb lattice. Each bond in the lattice is assigned a label <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \{ x, y, z\}\)</span> and that bond couple two spins along the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> axis. See fig. <a href="#fig:intro_figure_by_hand">1</a> for a diagram of the setup.</p>
<p>This gives us the Hamiltonian <span id="eq:bg-kh-model"><span class="math display">\[ H =  - \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha} J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}, \qquad{(1)}\]</span></span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha_j\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> component of a Pauli matrix acting on site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha\)</span> is a pair of nearest-neighbour indices connected by an <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-bond with exchange coupling <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span>. Kitaev introduced this model in his seminal 2006 paper <span class="citation" data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"> [<a href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The KH can arise as the result of strong spin-orbit couplings in, for example, the transition metal based compounds <span class="citation" data-cites="Jackeli2009 HerrmannsAnRev2018 Winter2017 TrebstPhysRep2022 Takagi2019"> [<a href="#ref-Jackeli2009" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>–<a href="#ref-Takagi2019" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. The model is highly frustrated: each spin would like to align along a different direction with each of its three neighbours. This cannot be achieved even classically <span class="citation" data-cites="chandraClassicalHeisenbergSpins2010 selaOrderbydisorderSpinorbitalLiquids2014"> [<a href="#ref-chandraClassicalHeisenbergSpins2010" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a href="#ref-selaOrderbydisorderSpinorbitalLiquids2014" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>. This frustration leads the the model to have a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, a complex many body state with a high degree of entanglement but no long range magnetic order even at zero temperature. While the possibility of a QSL ground state was suggested much earlier <span class="citation" data-cites="andersonResonatingValenceBonds1973"> [<a href="#ref-andersonResonatingValenceBonds1973" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>, the KH model was one of the first concrete models of the QSL state. The KH model has a rich ground state phase diagram with gapless and gapped phases, the latter supporting fractionalised quasiparticles with both Abelian and non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations. Anyons have been the subject of much attention because, among other reasons, they can be braided through spacetime to achieve noise tolerant quantum computations <span class="citation" data-cites="freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"> [<a href="#ref-freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>. At finite temperature the KH model undergoes a phase transition to a thermal metal state <span class="citation" data-cites="selfThermallyInducedMetallic2019"> [<a href="#ref-selfThermallyInducedMetallic2019" role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span>. The KH model can be solved exactly via a mapping to Majorana fermions. This mapping yields an extensive number of static <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z_2\)</span> fluxes tied to an emergent gauge field with the remaining fermions are governed by a free fermion hamiltonian.</p>
<p>This section will go over the standard model in detail, first discussing <a href="../2_Background/2.2_HKM_Model.html#the-spin-model">the spin model</a>, then detailing the transformation to a <a href="../2_Background/2.2_HKM_Model.html#the-majorana-model">Majorana hamiltonian</a> that allows a full solution while enlarging the Hamiltonian. We will discuss the properties of the <a href="#emergent-gauge-fields">emergent gauge fields</a> and the projector. We will then discuss the <a href="#bg-the-ground-state">ground state</a> found via Lieb’s theorem as well as work on generalisations of the ground state to other lattices. Finally we will look at the phase diagram.</p>
<p>The <a href="#anyonic-statistics">next section</a> will discuss anyons, topology and the Chern number, using the Kitaev model as an explicit example of these topics.</p>

<h2>The Spin Model</h2>
<p>As discussed in the introduction, spin hamiltonians like that of the Kitaev model arise in electronic systems as the result the balance of multiple effects <span class="citation" data-cites="TrebstPhysRep2022"> [<a href="#ref-TrebstPhysRep2022" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span>. For instance, in certain transition metal systems with <span class="math inline">\(d^5\)</span> valence electrons, crystal field and spin-orbit couplings conspire to shift and split the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> orbitals into moments with spin <span class="math inline">\(j = 1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j = 3/2\)</span>. Of these, the bandwidth <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(j= 1/2\)</span> band is small, meaning that even relatively meagre electron correlations (such those induced by the <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> term in the Hubbard model) can lead to the opening of a Mott gap. From there we have a <span class="math inline">\(j = 1/2\)</span> Mott insulator whose effective spin-spin interactions are again shaped by the lattice geometry and spin-orbit coupling leading some materials to have strong bond-directional Ising-type interactions <span class="citation" data-cites="jackeliMottInsulatorsStrong2009 khaliullinOrbitalOrderFluctuations2005"> [<a href="#ref-jackeliMottInsulatorsStrong2009" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>,<a href="#ref-khaliullinOrbitalOrderFluctuations2005" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span>. In the Kitaev Model the bond directionality refers to the fact that the coupling axis <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in terms like <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}\)</span> is strongly bond dependent.</p>
<p>In the spin hamiltonian eq. <a href="#eq:bg-kh-model">1</a> we can already tease out a set of conserved fluxes that will be key to the model’s solution. These fluxes are the expectations of Wilson loop operators</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{W}_p = \prod_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha\; \in\; p} \sigma_i^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha},\]</span></p>
<p>the products of bonds winding around a closed path <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the lattice. These operators commute with the Hamiltonian and so have no time dynamics. The winding direction does not matter so long as it is fixed. By convention we will always use clockwise. Each closed path on the lattice is associated with a flux. The number of conserved quantities grows linearly with system size and is thus extensive, this is a common property for exactly solvable systems and can be compared to the heavy electrons present in the Falikov-Kimball model. The square of two loop operators is one so any contractible loop can be expressed as a product of loops around plaquettes of the lattice, as in fig. <a href="#fig:stokes_theorem">2</a>. For the honeycomb lattice the plaquettes are the hexagons. The expectations of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{W}_p\)</span> through each plaquette, the fluxes, are therefore enough to describe the whole flux sector. We will focus on these fluxes, denoting them by <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span>. Once we have made the mapping to the Majorana Hamiltonian I will explain how these fluxes can be connected to an emergent <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> field which makes their interpretation as fluxes clear.</p>

As a consequence we need only to keep track of the value of the flux through each plaquette \phi_i. This relationship between the u_{ij} around a region and fluxes with one is evocative of Stokes’ theorem for classical electromagnetism. In fact it turns out to be the exponential of it as we shall make explicit later." />

<p>It is worth noting in passing that the effective Hamiltonian for many Kitaev materials incorporates a contribution from an isotropic Heisenberg term <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i,j} \vec{\sigma}_i\cdot\vec{\sigma}_j\)</span>, this is referred to as the Heisenberg-Kitaev Model <span class="citation" data-cites="Chaloupka2010"> [<a href="#ref-Chaloupka2010" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span>. Materials for which the Kitaev term dominates are generally known as Kitaev Materials. See <span class="citation" data-cites="TrebstPhysRep2022"> [<a href="#ref-TrebstPhysRep2022" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span> for a full discussion of Kitaev Materials.</p>
<p>As with the Falikov-Kimball model, the KH model has a extensive number of conserved quantities, the fluxes. As with the FK model it will make sense to work in the simultaneous eigenbasis of the fluxes and the Hamiltonian so that we can treat the fluxes like a classical degree of freedom. This is part of what makes the model tractable. We will find that the ground state of the model corresponds to some particular choice of fluxes. We will refer to local excitations away from the flux ground state as <strong>vortices</strong>. In order to fully solve the model however, we must first move to a Majorana picture.</p>

<p>Majorana fermions are something like ‘half of a complex fermion’ and are their own antiparticle. From a set of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> fermionic creation <span class="math inline">\(f_i^\dagger\)</span> and anhilation <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> operators we can construct <span class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> Majorana operators <span class="math inline">\(c_m\)</span>. We can do this construction in multiple ways subject to only mild constraints required to keep the overall commutations relations correct <span class="citation" data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"> [<a href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. Majorana operators square to one but otherwise have standard fermionic commutation relations.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> spins can be mapped to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> fermions with the well known Jordan-Wigner transformation and indeed this approach can be used to solve the Kitaev model <span class="citation" data-cites="chenExactResultsKitaev2008"> [<a href="#ref-chenExactResultsKitaev2008" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span>. Here I will introduce the method Kitaev used in the original paper as this forms the basis for the results that will be presented in this thesis. Rather than mapping to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> fermions, Kitaev maps to <span class="math inline">\(4N\)</span> Majoranas, effectively <span class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> fermions. In contrast to the Jordan-Wigner approach which makes fermions out of strings of spin operators in order to correctly produce fermionic commutation relations, the Kitaev transformation maps each spin locally to four Majoranas. The downside is that this enlarges the Hilbert space from <span class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(4^N\)</span>. We will have to employ a projector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}\)</span> to come back down to the physical Hilbert space later. As everything is local, I will drop the site indices <span class="math inline">\(ijk\)</span> in expressions that refer to only a single site.</p>
<p>The mapping is defined in terms of four Majoranas per site <span class="math inline">\(b_i^x,\;b_i^y,\;b_i^z,\;c_i\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span id="eq:bg-kh-mapping"><span class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^x = i b^x c,\; \tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c,\; \tilde{\sigma}^z = i b^z c\qquad{(2)}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The tildes on the spin operators <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\sigma_i^\alpha}\)</span> emphasis that they live in this new extended Hilbert space and are only equivalent to the original spin operators after applying a projector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}\)</span>. The form of the projection operator can be understood in a few ways. From a group-theoretic perspective, before projection, the operators <span class="math inline">\(\{\tilde{\sigma}^x, \tilde{\sigma}^y, \tilde{\sigma}^z\}\)</span> form a representation of the gamma group <span class="math inline">\(G_{3,0}\)</span>. The gamma groups <span class="math inline">\(G_{p,q}\)</span> have <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> generators that square to the identity and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that square (roughly) to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. The generators otherwise obey standard anticommutation relations. The well known gamma matrices <span class="math inline">\(\{\gamma^0, \gamma^1, \gamma^2, \gamma^3\}\)</span> represent <span class="math inline">\(G_{1,3}\)</span> the quaternions <span class="math inline">\(G_{0,3}\)</span> and the Pauli matrices <span class="math inline">\(G_{3,0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Pauli matrices, however, have the additional property that the <em>chiral element</em> <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^x \sigma^y \sigma^z = i\)</span>, this relation is not determined by the group properties of <span class="math inline">\(G_{3,0}\)</span>. Therefore to fully reproduce the algebra of the Pauli matrices we must project into the subspace where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\sigma}^x \tilde{\sigma}^y \tilde{\sigma}^z = i\)</span>. The chiral element of the gamma matrices for instance <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_5 = i\gamma^0 \gamma^1 \gamma^2 \gamma^3\)</span> is of central importance in quantum field theory. See <span class="citation" data-cites="petitjeanChiralityDiracSpinors2020"> [<a href="#ref-petitjeanChiralityDiracSpinors2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a>]</span> for more discussion of this group theoretic view.</p>
<p>The projector must project onto the subspace where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\sigma}^x \tilde{\sigma}^y \tilde{\sigma}^z = i\)</span>. If we work this through we find that in general $<sup>x</sup>y^z = iD $ where <span class="math inline">\(D = b^x b^y b^z c\)</span> must be the identity for every site. In other words, we can only work with <em>physical states</em> <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle\)</span> that satisfy $ D_i|= |$ for all sites <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. From this we construct an on-site projector <span class="math inline">\(P_i = \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\)</span> and the overall projector is simply <span class="math inline">\(P = \prod_i P_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another way to see what this is doing physically is to explicitly construct the two intermediate fermionic operators <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> that give rise to these four Majoranas. Working through the algebra we see that the <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> operator corresponds to the fermion parity <span class="math inline">\(D = -(2n_f - 1)(2n_g - 1)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_f,\; n_g\)</span> are the number operators. Expanding the product <span class="math inline">\(\prod_i P_i\)</span> out, we find that the projector corresponds to a symmetrisation over <span class="math inline">\(\{u_{ij}\}\)</span> states within a flux sector and and overall fermion parity <span class="math inline">\(\prod_i D_i\)</span>. This tells us that any arbitrary state can be made to have non-zero overlap with the physical subspace via the addition or removal of a single fermion. This implies that in the thermodynamic limit the projection step is not generally necessary to extract physical results, see <span class="citation" data-cites="pedrocchiPhysicalSolutionsKitaev2011"> [<a href="#ref-pedrocchiPhysicalSolutionsKitaev2011" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> or <a href="../6_Appendices/A.5_The_Projector.html#app-the-projector">appendix A.5</a> for more details.</p>
<p>We can now rewrite the spin hamiltonian in Majorana form with caveat that they are only strictly equivalent after projection. The Ising interactions <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}\)</span> decouple into the form <span class="math inline">\(-i (i b^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j) c_i c_j\)</span>. We factor out the <em>bond operators</em> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij} = i b^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j\)</span> which are Hermitian and, remarkably, commute with the Hamiltonian and each other.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{H} &amp;=  - \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha} J^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_i^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_j^{\alpha}\\
          &amp;=  i \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha} J^{\alpha} \hat{u}_{ij} \hat{c}_i \hat{c}_j
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The bond operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij}\)</span> square to one so have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span>. As they’re conserved we will work in their eigenbasis and take off the hats in the Hamiltonian.</p>
<p><span id="eq:bg-kh-maj-model"><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<h2>The Fermion Problem</h2>
<p>We now have a quadratic Hamiltonian, eq. <a href="#eq:bg-kh-maj-model">3</a>, coupled to a classical field <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>. What follows is relatively standard theory for quadratic Hamiltonians <span class="citation" data-cites="BlaizotRipka1986"> [<a href="#ref-BlaizotRipka1986" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Because of the antisymmetry <span class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>, the eigenvalues of eq. <a href="#eq:bg-kh-maj-model">3</a> come in pairs <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span>. We organise the eigenmodes of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> into pairs, such that <span class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_m&#39;\)</span> have energies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-\epsilon_m\)</span>. The transformation <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> <span class="math display">\[(c_1, c_2... c_{2N}) Q = (b_1, b_1&#39;, b_2, b_2&#39; ... b_{N}, b_{N}&#39;)\]</span> puts the Hamiltonian into normal mode form <span class="math display">\[\tilde{H}_u = \frac{i}{2} \sum_m \epsilon_m b_m b_m&#39;.\]</span></p>
<p>The determinant of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> appears when evaluating the projector explicitly, otherwise, the <span class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> are merely an intermediate step. From them, we form fermionic operators <span class="math display">\[ f_i = \tfrac{1}{2} (b_m + ib_m&#39;)\]</span> with their associated number operators <span class="math inline">\(n_i = f^\dagger_i f_i\)</span>.

<p>In addition, the bond operators form a highly degenerate description of the system. The operators <span class="math inline">\(D_i = b^x_i b^y_i b^z_i c_i\)</span> commute with <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> so form a set of local symmetries. The action of <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> on a state is to flip the values of the three <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> bonds that connect to site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. This changes the bond configuration <span class="math inline">\(\{u_{ij}\}\)</span> but leaves the flux configuration <span class="math inline">\(\{\phi_i\}\)</span> unchanged. Physically, we interpret <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> as a gauge field with a high degree of degeneracy and <span class="math inline">\(\{D_i\}\)</span> as the set of gauge symmetries. The Majorana bond operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are an emergent, classical, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z_2}\)</span> gauge field! The flux configuration <span class="math inline">\(\{\phi_i\}\)</span> is what encodes physical information about the system.</p>
<p>The ground state of the Kitaev Honeycomb model has flux configuration <span class="math inline">\(\{\phi_i = +1\}\)</span>. This can be proven via Lieb’s theorem <span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"> [<a href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span> which gives the gives the lowest energy magnetic flux configuration for a system of electrons hopping in a magnetic field. Kitaev remarks in his original paper that he was not initially aware of the relevance of Lieb’s 1994 result. This is not surprising because at first glance the two models seem quite different but the connection is quite instructive to understanding the Kitaev Model and its generalisations.</p>
<p>Lieb discusses a model of mobile electrons</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H = \sum_{ij} t_{ij} c^\dagger_i c_j\]</span></p>
<p>where the hopping term <span class="math inline">\(t_{ij} = |t_{ij}|\exp(i\theta_{ij})\)</span> incorporate Aharanhov-Bohm <span class="citation" data-cites="aharonovSignificanceElectromagneticPotentials1959"> [<a href="#ref-aharonovSignificanceElectromagneticPotentials1959" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span> (AB) phases <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij}\)</span>. The AB phases model the effect of a slowly varying magnetic field on the electrons through the integral of the magnetic vector potential <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij} = \int_i^j \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l}\)</span>, a Peierls substitution <span class="citation" data-cites="peierlsZurTheorieDiamagnetismus1933"> [<a href="#ref-peierlsZurTheorieDiamagnetismus1933" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>]</span>. If we map the Majorana form of the Kitaev model to Lieb’s model we see that the <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = \pm 1\)</span> correspond to AB phases <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{ij} = 0,\pi\)</span> along each bond. Stokes’ theorem tells us that the magnetic flux <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\phi}_m\)</span> through a surface <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is related to the line integral of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> along the boundary of the surface <span class="math inline">\(\partial S\)</span> which in the discrete case reduces to the sum of the AB phases along the path. We can thus rewrite eq. <a href="#eq:flux-majorana">4</a> as</p>
<p><span id="eq:flux-magnetic"><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\phi_i &amp;= i^n \prod_{\mathcal{P}_i} \exp{(i\theta_{jk}})\\
       &amp;= i^n \exp \left( i \sum_{\mathcal{P}_i} \theta_{jk} \right)\\
       &amp;= i^n \exp \left( i \oint_{\mathcal{P}_i} \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l} \right)
\end{aligned}\qquad{(5)}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Thus we can interpret the fluxes <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> as the exponential of magnetic fluxes of some fictitious gauge field <span class="math inline">\(\vec{A}\)</span> and the bond operators as <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = \exp i \int_i^j \vec{A} \cdot d\vec{l}\)</span>. In this analogy to classical electromagnetism, the sets <span class="math inline">\(\{u_ij\}\)</span> that correspond to the same <span class="math inline">\(\{\phi_i\}\)</span> are all gauge equivalent. The fact that fluxes can be written as products of bond operators and composed is a consequence of (the exponential of) Stokes’ theorem. The additional phase factors of <span class="math inline">\(i^n\)</span> can be incorporated as additional <span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{\pi}{2}\)</span> phases but then make little difference when all the plaquettes are hexagons or have an even number of sides. However if the lattice contains odd plaquettes, as in the Yao-Kivelson model <span class="citation" data-cites="yaoExactChiralSpin2007"> [<a href="#ref-yaoExactChiralSpin2007" role="doc-biblioref">22</a>]</span>, the complex fluxes that appear are a sign that chiral symmetry has been broken.</p>
<p>Understanding <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> as a gauge field provides another way to understand the action of the projector. The local projector <span class="math inline">\(P_i = \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\)</span> applied to a state constructs a superposition of the original state and the gauge equivalent state linked to it by flipping the three <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> around site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The overall projector <span class="math inline">\(P = \prod_i P_i\)</span> can thus be understood as a symmetrisation over all gauge equivalent states, removing the gauge degeneracy introduced by the mapping from spins to Majoranas.</p>

(Left) The product of sets of D_j operators (Bold Vertices) can be used to construct arbitrary contractible loops that flip u_{ij} values.

(Right) In black and red the edges and dual edges that must be flipped to add vortices at the sites highlighted in orange. Flipping all the plaquettes in the system is not equivalent to the identity.

<p>A final but important point to mention is that is that the local fluxes <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> are not quite all there is. We’ve seen that products of <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> can be used to construct the flux associated with arbitrary contractible loops. On the plane contractible loops are all there are. However, on the torus we can construct two global fluxes <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_y\)</span> which correspond to paths tracing the major and minor axes. The four sectors spanned by the <span class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span> values of these fluxes are gapped away from one another but only by virtual tunnelling processes so the gap decays exponentially with system size <span class="citation" data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"> [<a href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. Physically <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_y\)</span> could be thought of as measuring the flux that threads through the hole of the doughnut. In general, surfaces with genus <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> have <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> ‘handles’ and <span class="math inline">\(2g\)</span> of these global fluxes. At first glance it may seem this would not have much relevance to physical realisations of the Kitaev model that will likely have a planar geometry with open boundary conditions. However these fluxes are closely linked to topology and the existence of anyonic quasiparticle excitations in the model, which we will discuss next.</p>

</figure>
<p>To discuss different ground state phases of the KH model we must first review the topic of anyons and topology. The standard argument for the existence of Fermions and Bosons goes like this: the quantum state of a system must pick up a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span> if two identical particles are swapped. Only <span class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span> are allowed since swapping twice must correspond to the identity. This argument works in three dimensions for states without topological degeneracy, which seems to be true of the real world, but condensed matter systems are subject to no such constraints.</p>
<p>In gapped condensed matter systems, all equal time correlators decay exponentially with distance <span class="citation" data-cites="hastingsLiebSchultzMattisHigherDimensions2004"> [<a href="#ref-hastingsLiebSchultzMattisHigherDimensions2004" role="doc-biblioref">24</a>]</span>. Put another way, the system supports quasiparticles with a definite location in space and a finite extent. As such it is meaningful to consider what would happen to the overall quantum state if we were to adiabatically carry out a series of swaps as described above. This is known as braiding.</p>
<p>First we realise that in two dimensions, swapping identical particles twice is not topologically equivalent to the identity, see fig. <a href="#fig:braiding">5</a>. Instead it corresponds to encircling one particle around the other. This means we can in general pick up any complex phase <span class="math inline">\(e^{i\theta}\)</span>, hence the name <strong>any</strong>-ons upon exchange. These are known as Abelian anyons because complex multiplication commutes and hence the group of braiding operations forms and Abelian group.</p>
<p>The KH model has a topologically degenerate ground state with sectors labelled by the values of the topological fluxes <span class="math inline">\((\Phi_x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_y)\)</span>. Consider the operation in which a quasiparticle pair is created from the ground state, transported around one of the non-contractible loops and then annihilated together, call them <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{y}\)</span>. These operations move us around within the ground state manifold and they need not commute. This leads to non-Abelian anyons. As Kitaev points out, these operations are not specific to the torus: the operation <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{x}\mathcal{T}_{y}\mathcal{T}_{x}^{-1}\mathcal{T}_{y}^{-1}\)</span> corresponds to an operation in which none of the particles crosses the torus, rather one simply winds around the other, hence these effects of relevant even for the planar case.</p>

<p>Setting the overall energy scale with the constraint <span class="math inline">\(J_x + J_y + J_z = 1\)</span> yields a triangular phase diagram.

Both phases support two kinds of quasiparticles, fermions and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_2\)</span>-vortices. In the A phases, the vortices have bosonic statistics with respect to themselves but act like fermions with respect to the fermions, hence they are Abelian anyons, This phase has the same anyonic structure as the Toric code <span class="citation" data-cites="kitaev_fault-tolerant_2003"> [<a href="#ref-kitaev_fault-tolerant_2003" role="doc-biblioref">30</a>]</span>. Since the B phase is gapless, the quasiparticles aren’t localised and so don’t have braiding statistics.</p>
<p>An external magnetic can be used to break chiral symmetry. The lowest order term that breaks chiral symmetry but retains the solvability of the model is the three spin term <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{(i,j,k)} \sigma_i^{\alpha} \sigma_j^{\beta} \sigma_k^{\gamma}
\]</span> where the sum <span class="math inline">\((i,j,k)\)</span> runs over consecutive indices around plaquettes. The addition of this to the spin model leads to two bond terms in the corresponding Majorana model. The effect of breaking chiral symmetry is to open a gap in the B phase. The vortices of the gapped B phase are non-Abelian anyons.</p>
<p>At finite temperatures, recent work has shown that the KH model undergoes a transition to a thermal metal phase.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> The Kitaev Honeycomb model is remarkable because it combines three key properties. First, the form of the Hamiltonian plausibly be realised by a real material. Candidate materials, such as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\mathrm{-RuCl}_3\)</span>, are known to have sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling and the correct lattice structure to behave according to the Kitaev Honeycomb model with small corrections <span class="citation" data-cites="banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016 TrebstPhysRep2022"> [<a href="#ref-TrebstPhysRep2022" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>,<a href="#ref-banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016" role="doc-biblioref">34</a>]</span>. Second, its ground state is the canonical example of the long sought after quantum spin liquid state. Its excitations are anyons, particles that can only exist in two dimensions that break the normal fermion/boson dichotomy.</p>
<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, this model is a rare many body interacting quantum system that can be treated analytically. It is exactly solvable. We can explicitly write down its many body ground states in terms of single particle states <span class="citation" data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"> [<a href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. The solubility of the Kitaev Honeycomb Model, like the Falikov-Kimball model of chapter 1, comes about because the model has extensively many conserved degrees of freedom. These conserved quantities can be factored out as classical degrees of freedom, leaving behind a non-interacting quantum model that is easy to solve.</p>

<li>The A phase: The three anisotropic regions of the phase diagram <span class="math inline">\(A_x, A_y, A_z\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A_\alpha\)</span> means <span class="math inline">\(J_\alpha &gt;&gt; J_\beta, J_\gamma\)</span>.</li>
<li>The B phase: The roughly isotropic region of the phase diagram.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vortices and their movements</strong></p>
<p>See fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">6</a> for a diagram of the next three paragraphs.</p>
<p>We started from the ground state of the model and flipped the sign of a single bond (fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">6</a> (a)). In doing so, we will flip the sign of the two plaquettes adjacent to that bond. We will call these disturbed plaquettes <em>vortices</em>. We will refer to a particular choice values for the plaquette operators as a <em>vortex sector</em>.</p>
<p>If we chain multiple bond flips, we can create a pair of vortices at arbitrary locations (fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">6</a> (b)). The chain of bonds that we must flip corresponds to a path on the dual of the lattice.</p>
<p>We can also create a pair of vortices, move one around a loop and finally annihilate it with its partner (fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">6</a> (c)). This corresponds to a closed loop on the dual lattice. Applying such a bond flip leaves the vortex sector unchanged. We can also do the same thing but move the vortex around one the non-contractible loops of the lattice (fig. <a href="#fig:types_of_dual_loops_animated">6</a> (d)).</p>
<p>There is one kind of dual loop that we cannot build out of <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>s, the non-contractible loops.</p>
