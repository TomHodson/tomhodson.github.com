<h2 id="gauge-fields">Gauge Fields</h2>
<p>The bond operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are
useful because they label a bond sector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}_u\)</span> in which we can
easiy solve the Hamiltonian. However the gauge operators move us between
bond sectors. <strong>Bond sectors are not gauge invariant!</strong></p>
<p>Let’s consider instead the properties of the plaquette operators
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\phi}_i\)</span> that live on the faces
of the lattice.</p>
<p>We already showed that they are conserved. And as one might hope and
expect, the plaquette operators map cleanly on to the bond operators of
the Majorana representation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{W}_p &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} \tilde{K}_{ij}\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p}
\tilde{\sigma}_i^\alpha \tilde{\sigma}_j^\alpha\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} (ib^\alpha_i
c_i)(ib^\alpha_j c_j)\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} i u_{ij} c_i c_j\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} i u_{ij}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the last steps holds because each <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> appears exactly twice and adjacent to
its neighbour in each plaquette operator. Note that this is consistent
with the observation from earlier that each <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> takes values <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> for even paths and <span
class="math inline">\(\pm i\)</span> for odd paths.</p>
<h3 id="vortices-and-their-movements">Vortices and their movements</h3>
<p>Let’s imagine we started from the ground state of the model and
flipped the sign of a single bond. In doing so we will flip the sign of
the two plaquettes adjacent to that bond. I’ll call these disturbed
plaquettes <em>vortices</em>. I’ll refer to a particular choice values
for the plaquette operators as a vortex sector.</p>
<p>If we chain multiple bond flips we can create a pair of vortices at
arbitrary locations. The chain of bonds that we must flip corresponds to
a path on the dual of the lattice.</p>
<p>Something else we can do is create a pair of vortices, move one
around a loop and then anhilate it with its partner. This corresponds to
a closed loop on the dual lattice and applying such a bond flip leaves
the vortex sector unchanged.</p>
<p>Notice that the <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators
flip three bonds around a vertex. This is the smallest closed loop
around which one can move a vortex pair and anhilate it with itself.</p>
<p>Such operations compose in the sense that we can build any larger
loop by applying a series of <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
operations. Indeed the symetrisation procedure <span
class="math inline">\(\prod_i \left( \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\right)\)</span>
that maps from the bond sector to a physical state is applying
constructing a superposition over every such loop that leaves the vortex
sector unchanged.</p>
<p>The only loops that we cannot build out of <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>s are non-contractible loops, such as
those that span the major or minor circumference of the torus.</p>
<p><strong>The plaquette operators are the gauge invariant quantity that
determines the physics of the model</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Second it is now easy to show that the loops and plaquettes satisfy
nice composition rules, so long as we stick to loops that wind in a
particular direction.</p>
<p>Consider the product of two non-overlapping loops <span
class="math inline">\(W_a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(W_b\)</span> that share an edge <span
class="math inline">\(u_{12}\)</span>. Since the two loops both wind
clockwise and do not overlap, one will contain a term <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{12}\)</span> and the other <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{21}\)</span>. Since the <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> commute with one another, they
square to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = -u_{ji}\)</span> we see have <span
class="math inline">\(i u_{12} i u_{21} = 1\)</span> and we can repeat
this for any number of shared edges. Hence, we get a version of Stokes’
theorem: the product of <span class="math inline">\(i u_{jk}\)</span>
around any closed loop <span class="math inline">\(\partial A\)</span>
is equal to the product of plaquette operators <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> that span the area <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> enclosed by that loop: <span
class="math display">\[\prod_{u_{jk} \in \partial A} i \; u_{jk} =
\prod_{\phi_i \in A} \phi_i\]</span></p>

<p>We can check this analysis with a counting argument. For a lattice
with <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> bonds, <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> plaquettes and <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> vertices we can count how many bond
sectors, vortices sectors and gauge symmetries there are and check them
against Euler’s polyhedra equation.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>For the case of the torus where <span class="math inline">\(g =
1\)</span> we can rearrange this to read: <span class="math display">\[B
= (P-1) + (V-1) + 2\]</span></p>
<p>Each <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> takes two values and
there is one associated with each bond so there are exactly <span
class="math inline">\(2^B\)</span> distinct configurations of the bond
sector. Let’s see if we can factor those configurations out into the
cartesian product of vortex sectors, gauge symmetries and
non-contractible loop operators.</p>
<p>Vortex sectors: each plaquette operator <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> takes two values (<span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\pm
i\)</span>) and there are <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of them
so naively one would think there are <span
class="math inline">\(2^P\)</span>. However vortices can only be created
on pairs so there are really <span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{2^P}{2}
= 2^{P-1}\)</span> vortex sectors.</p>
<p>Gauge symmetries: As discussed earlier these correspond to the all
possible compositions of the <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
operators. Again there are only <span
class="math inline">\(2^{V-1}\)</span> of these because, as we will see
in the next section, <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j} D_j =
\mathbb{1}\)</span> in the physical space, and we enforce this by
chooising the correct product of single particle fermion states. You can
get an intuitive picture for why <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j}
D_j = \mathbb{1}\)</span> by imagining larger and larger patches of
<span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators on the torus. These
patches correspond to transporting a vortex pair around the edge of the
patch. At some point the patch wraps around and starts to cover the
entire torus, as this happens the bounday of the patch disappears and
hence it which corresponds to the identity operation. See Fig ??
(animated in the HTML version).</p>
<p>Finally the torus has two non-contractible loop operators asscociated
with its major and minor diameters.</p>
<p>Putting this all together we see that there are <strong><span
class="math inline">\(2^B\)</span> bond sectors</strong> a space which
can be decomposed into the cartesian product of <strong><span
class="math inline">\(2^{P-1}\)</span> vortex sectors</strong>,
<strong><span class="math inline">\(2^{V-1}\)</span> gauge
symmetries</strong> and <strong><span class="math inline">\(2^2 =
4\)</span> topological sectors</strong> associated with the
non-contractible loop operators. This last factor forms the basis of
proposals to construct topologically protected qubits since the 4
sectors cold only be mixed by a highly non-local perturbation, ref
?????.</p>

alt="The different kinds of strings and loops that we can make by flipping bond variables. (a) Flipping a single bond makes a pair of vortices on either side. (b) Flipping a string of bonds separates the vortex pair spatially. The flipped bonds form a path in blue on the dual lattice. (c) If we create a vortex-vortex pair, transported one of them around a loop and then anhilate them we can change the bond sector without changing the vortex sector. This is a manifestation of the gauge symmetry of the bond sector. (d) If we transport a vortex around the major or minor axes of the torus we create a non-contractable loop of bonds. These are relevant because they cannot be constructed from the contractable loops created by D_j operators." />

These loops are not directed as they are in the case of the Wilson loops. (right) A non-contractable loop which cannot be produced by composing D_j operators.

<h3 id="counting-edges-plaquettes-and-vertices">Counting edges,
plaquettes and vertices</h3>
<p>It will be useful to know how the trivalent structre of the lattice
constraints the number of bonds <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>,
plaquettes <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and vertices <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> it has.</p>
<p>We can immediately see that the lattice is built from vertices that
each share 3 edges with their neighbours. This means each vertex comes
with <span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{3}{2}\)</span> bonds i.e <span
class="math inline">\(3V = 2B\)</span>. This is consistent with the fact
that in the Majorana representation on the torus each vertex brings
three <span class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators which then
pair along bonds to give <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> bonds
per vertex.</p>
<p>If we define an integer <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(V = 2N\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B = 3N\)</span> and substitite this into the
polyhedra equation for the torus we see that <span
class="math inline">\(P = N\)</span>. So if is a trivalent lattice on
the torus has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes, it has
<span class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> bonds.</p>
<p>We can also consider the sum of the number of bonds in each plaquette
<span class="math inline">\(S_p\)</span>, since each bond is a member of
exactly two plaquettes <span class="math display">\[S_p = 2B =
6N\]</span></p>
<p>The mean size of a plaquette in a trivalent lattice on the torus is
exactly 6. Since the sum is even, this also tells us that all odd
plaquettes must come in pairs.</p>

<p>It will turn out that the projection from the extended space to the
physical space is not actually that important for the results that I
will present. However it it useful to go through the theory of it to
explain why this is.</p>
<p>The physicil states are defined as those for which <span
class="math inline">\(D_i |\phi\rangle = |\phi\rangle\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> has eigenvalues <span

<p>for a toroidal trivalent lattice with <span

product over <span class="math inline">\((1 + D_j)\)</span> can also be
thought of as the sum of all possible subsets <span

possible gauge symmetry operations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{2^{2N}}
\sum_{\{i\}} \prod_{i\in\{i\}} D_i\]</span></p>
<p>Since the gauge operators <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
commute and square to one, we can define the complement operator <span
class="math inline">\(C = \prod_{i=1}^{2N} D_i\)</span> and see that it
take each set of <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{i \in \{i\}}
D_j\)</span> operators and gives us the complement of that set. I said
earlier that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the identity in
the physical subspace and we will shortly see why.</p>
<p>We use the complement operator to rewrite the projector as a sum over
half the subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\{i\}\)</span> let’s
call that <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. The complement
operator deals with the other half</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{P} =  \left(
\frac{1}{2^{2N-1}} \sum_{\Lambda} \prod_{i\in\{i\}} D_i\right)

<p>To compute <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0\)</span> the

<p>First we reorder the operators by bond type, this doesn’t require any

class="math inline">\(det(Q^u) \prod -i u_{ij}\)</span> has an
interesting relationship to the topological fluxes. In the non-Abelian
phase we expect that it will change sign in exactly on of the four
topological sectors. This forces that sector that contain a fermion and
hence gives the model a three-fold degerenate ground state. In the
Abelian phase this doesn’t happen and we get a fourfold degerate ground
state. Whether this analysis generalises to the amorphous case in
unclear.</p>
<p>An alternate way to view this is to consider the adiabatic insertion
of the fluxes <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{x,y}\)</span> as the
operations that undo vortex transport around the lattice. In this
picture the three fold degeneracy occurs because transporting a vortex
around <strong>both</strong> the major and minor axes of the torus
changes its fusion channel such that the two vortices fuse into a
fermion excition rather than the vacuum.</p>
<p>All these factors take values <span class="math inline">\(\pm
1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0\)</span> is 0 or
1 for a particular state. Since <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> corresponds to symmetrising
over all the gauge configurations and cannot be 0, this tells use that
once we have determined the single particle eigenstates of a bond
sector, the true many body ground state has the same energy as either
the empty state with <span class="math inline">\(n_i = 0\)</span> or a
state with a single fermion in the lowest level.</p>
<p>Let’s think about where are with the model now. We can map the spin
Hamiltonian to a Majorana Hamiltonian in an extended Hilbert space.
Along with that mapping comes a gauge field <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> defining <strong>bond
sectors</strong>. The gauge symmetries of <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> are generated by the set of <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators. The gauge invariant and
therefore physically relevant variables are the plaquette operators
<span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> which define as a
<strong>vortex sector</strong>. In order to practically solve the
Majorana Hamiltonian we must remove hats from the gauge field by
restricting ourselves to a particular bond sector. From there the
Majorana Hamiltonian becomes non-interacting and we can solve it like
any quadratic theory. This lets us construct the single particle
eigenstates from which we can also construct many body states. However
the many body states constructed this way are not in the physical
subspace!</p>
<p>However for the many body states within a particular bond sector,
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0 = 0,1\)</span> tells us which
of those have some overlap with the physical sector.</p>
<p>We see that finding a state that has overlap with a physical state
only ever requires the addition or removal of one fermion. There are
cases where this can make a difference but for most observables such as
ground state energy this correction scales away as the number of
fermions in the system grows.</p>
<p>If we wanted to construct a full many body wavefunction in the spin
basis we would need to include the full symmetrisation over the gauge
fields. However this was not necessary for any of the results that will
be presented here.</p>
<h2 id="the-ground-state">The Ground State</h2>
<p>As we have shown that the Hamiltonian is gauge invariant, only the
flux sector and the two topological fluxes affect the spectrum of the
Hamiltonian. Thus we can label many body ground state by a combination
of flux sector and fermionic occupation numbers.</p>
<p>By studying the projector we saw that the fermionic occupation
numbers of the ground state will always be either <span
class="math inline">\(n_m = 0\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(n_0 = 1, n_{m&gt;1} = 0\)</span> because the
projector really just enforces vortex and fermion parity.</p>
<p>I refer to the flux sector that contains the ground state as the
ground state flux sector. Recall that we call the excitations of the
fluxes away from the ground ground state configuration
<strong>vortices</strong>, so that the ground state flux sector is the
vortex free sector by definition.</p>
<p>On the Honeycomb, Lieb’s theorem implies that the the ground state
corresponds to the state where all <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk} =
1\)</span> implying that the flux free sector is the ground state
sector<span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"><sup><a
href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Lieb’s theorem does not generalise easily to the amorphous case.
However we can get some intuition by examining the problem that will
lead to a guess for the ground state. We will then provide numerical
evidence that this guess is in fact correct.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the partition function of the Majorana hamiltonian:
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = \mathrm{Tr}\left( e^{-\beta
H}\right) = \sum_i \exp{-\beta \epsilon_i}\]</span> At low temperatures
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z} \approx \beta
\epsilon_0\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is the lowest energy fermionic
state.</p>
<p>How does the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> depend
on the Majorana hamiltonian? Expanding the exponential out gives: <span
class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = \sum_n \frac{(-\beta)^n}{n!}
\mathrm{Tr(H^k)} \]</span></p>
<p>Now there’s an interesting observation to make here. The Hamiltonian
is essentially a scaled adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix being a
matrix <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(g_{ij} = 1\)</span> if vertices <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and joined by an edge and 0
otherwise.</p>
<p>Powers of adjacency matrices have the property that the entry <span
class="math inline">\((g^n)_{ij}\)</span> corresponds to the number of
paths of length n on the graph that begin at site <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and end at site <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. These include somewhat degenerate
paths that go back on themselves etc.</p>
<p>The trace of an adjacency matrix <span
class="math display">\[\mathrm{Tr}(g^n) = \sum_i (g^n)_{ii}\]</span>
therefore counts the number number of loops of size <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that can be drawn on the graph.</p>
<p>Applying the same treatment to our Majorana Hamiltonian, we can
interpret <span class="math inline">\(u_ij\)</span> to equal 0 if the
two sites are not joined by a bond and we put ourselves in the isotropic
phase where <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha = 1\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_{ij} =  \tfrac{1}{2} i
u_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>We then see that the trace of the nth power of H is a sums over
Wilson loops of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with an
additional factor of <span class="math inline">\(2^{-n}\)</span>. We
showed earlier that the Wilson loop operators can always be written as
products of the plaquette operators that they enclose.</p>
<p>Lumping all the prefactors together, we can write: <span
class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = c_A \hat{A} + c_B \hat{B} + \sum_i
c_i \hat{\phi}_i + \sum_{ij} c_{ij}  \hat{\phi}_i \hat{\phi}_j +
\sum_{ijk} c_{ijk}  \hat{\phi}_i \hat{\phi}_j \hat{\phi}_k +
...\]</span></p>
<p>Where the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> factors would be
something like <span class="math display">\[c_{ijk...} = \sum_n
\tfrac{(-\beta)^n}{n!} \tfrac{1}{2^n} K_{ijk...}\]</span> which is a sum
over all loop lengths <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and for
each we have a combinatoral factor <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ijk...}\)</span> that counts how many ways
there are to draw a loop of length <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that only encloses plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(ijk...\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also have the pesky non-contractible loop operators <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{A}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{B}\)</span>. Again the prefactors for these
are very complicated but we can intuitively see that for larger and
larger loops lengths there will be a combinatorial explosion of possible
ways that they appear in these sums. These are suppressed exponentially
with system size but at practical lattice sizes they cause significant
finite size effects. The main evidence of this is that the 4 loop
sectors spanned by the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{A}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{B}\)</span> operators are degenerate in
the infinite system size limit, while that degeneracy is lifted in
finite sized systems.</p>
<p>We don’t have much hope of actually evaluating this for an amorphous
lattice. However it lead us to guess that the ground state vortex sector
might be a simple function of the side length of each plaquette.</p>
<p>The ground state of the Amorphous Kitaev Model is found by setting
the flux through each plaquette <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to be equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\phi^{\mathrm{g.s.}}(n_{\mathrm{sides}})\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \phi^{\mathrm{g.s.}}(n_{\mathrm{sides}}) = -(\pm
i)^{n_{\mathrm{sides}}},
\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n_{\mathrm{sides}}\)</span> is the number of edges
that form each plaquette and the choice of sign gives a twofold chiral
ground state degeneracy.</p>
<p>This conjecture is consistent with Lieb’s theorem on regular
lattices<span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"><sup><a
href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> and
is supported by numerical evidence. As noted before, any flux that
differs from the ground state is an excitation which I call a
vortex.</p>
<h3 id="finite-size-effects">Finite size effects</h3>
<p>This guess only works for larger lattices because of the finite size
effects. In order to rigorously test it we would like to directly
enumerate the <span class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> vortex sectors
for a smaller lattice and check that the lowest state found is the
vortex sector predicted by ???.</p>
<p>To do this we tile use an amorphous lattice as the unit cell of a
periodic <span class="math inline">\(N\times N\)</span> system. Bonds
that originally crossed the periodic boundaries now connect adjacent
unit cells. Using Bloch’s theorem the problem then essnetially reduces
back to the single amorphous unit cell but now the edges that cross the
periodic boundaries pick up a phase dependent on the crystal momentum
<span class="math inline">\(\vex{q} = (q_x, q_y)\)</span> and the
lattice vector of the bond <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x} = (+1, 0,
-1, +1, 0, -1)\)</span>. Assigning these lattice vectors to each bond is
also a very conveninent way to store and plot toroidal graphs.</p>
<p>This can then be solved using Bloch’s theorem. For a given crystal
momentum <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{q} \in [0,2\pi)^2\)</span>,
we are left with a Bloch Hamiltonian, which is identical to the original
Hamiltonian aside from an extra phase on edges that cross the periodic
boundaries in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> directions, <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    M_{jk}(\textbf{q}) =  \frac{i}{2} J^{\alpha} u_{jk} e^{i
q_{jk}},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(q_{jk}
= q_x\)</span> for a bond that crosses the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-periodic boundary in the positive
direction, with the analogous definition for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-crossing bonds. We also have <span
class="math inline">\(q_{jk} = -q_{kj}\)</span>. Finally <span
class="math inline">\(q_{jk} = 0\)</span> if the edge does not cross any
boundaries at all – in essence we are imposing twisted boundary
conditions on our system. The total energy of the tiled system can be
calculated by summing the energy of <span class="math inline">\(M(
\textbf{q})\)</span> for every value of <span
class="math inline">\(\textbf{q}\)</span>. The use of a fourier series
then allows us to compute the diagonalisation with a penalty only linear
in the number of tiles used compared to diagonalising a single lattice.
With this technique the finite size effects related to the
non-contractible loop operators are removed with only a linear penalty
in computation time compared to the exponential penalty paid by simply
simply diagonalising larger lattices.</p>
<p>Using this technique we verified that <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span> correctly predicts the ground
state for hundreds of thousands of lattices with upto 20 plaquettes. For
larger lattices we verified that random perturbations around the
predicted ground state never yield a lower energy state.</p>
<h3 id="chiral-symmetry">Chiral Symmetry</h3>
<p>In the discussion above we see that the ground state has a twofold
<strong>chiral</strong> degeneracy that comes about because the global
sign of the odd plaquettes does not matter.</p>
<p>This happens because by adding odd plaquettes we have broken the time
reversal symmetry of the original model<span class="citation"

<p>Most thermodynamic and quantum phases studied can be characterised by
a local order parameter. That is, a function or operator that only
requires knowledge about some fixed sized patch of the system that does
not scale with system size.</p>
<p>However there are quantum phases that cannot be characterised by such
a local order parameter. These phases are intead said to posess
‘topological order’.</p>
<p>One property of topological order that is particularly easy to
observe that the ground state degeneracy depends on the topology of the
manifold that we put the system on to. This is referred to as
topological degeneracy to distinguish it from standard symmetry
breaking.</p>
<p>The Kitaev model will be a good example of this, we have already
looked at it defined on a graph that is embedded either into the plane
or onto the torus. The extension to surfaces like the torus but with
more than one handle is relatively easy.</p>
<h3 id="anyonic-statistics">Anyonic Statistics</h3>
<p>In dimensions greater than two, the quantum state of a system must
pick up a factor of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> if two identical particles are
swapped. We call these Fermions and Bosons.</p>
<p>This argument is predicated on the idea that performing two swaps is
equivalent to doing nothing. Doing nothing should not change the quantum
state at all, so doing one swap can at most multiply it by <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>However there are many hidden parts to this argument. Firstly, this
argument just isn’t the whole story, if you want to know why Fermions
have half integer spin, for instance, you have to go to field
theory.</p>
<p>There is also a second niggle, why does this argument only work in
dimensions greater than two? What we’re really saying when we say that
two swaps do nothing is that the world lines of two particles that have
been swapped twice can be untangled without crossing. Why can’t they
cross? Well because if they cross then the particles can interact and
the quantum state could change in an arbitrary way. We’re implcitly
using the locality of physics here to argue that if the worldlines stay
well separated then the overall quantum state cannot too much.</p>
<p>In two dimensions we cannot untangle the worldlines of two particles
that have swapped places, they are braided together. See fig. <a
href="#fig:braiding">5</a> for a diagram.</p>

<p>From this fact flows a whole new world of behaviours, now the quantum
state can aquire a phase factor <span
class="math inline">\(e^{i\phi}\)</span> upon exchange of two identical
particles, which we now call Anyons.</p>
<p>The Kitaev Model is a good demonstration of the connection beween
Anyons and topological degeneracy. In the Kitaev model we can create a
pair of vortices, move one around a non-contractable loop <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_{x/y}\)</span> and then anhilate them
together. Without topology this should leave the quantum state
unchanged. Instead it moves us to another ground state in a
topologically degenerate ground state subspace. Practically speaking it
flips a dual line of bonds <span class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span>
going around the loop which we cannot undo with any gauge transformation
made from <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>If the ground state subspace is multidimensional, quasiparticle
exchange can move us around in the space with an action corresponding to
a matrix. These matrices do not in general commmute and so these are
known as non-Abelian anyons.</p>
<p>From here things get even more complex, the Kitaev model has a
non-Abelian phase when exposed to a magnetic field, and the amorphous
Kitaev Model has a non-Abelian phase because of its broken chiral
symmetry.</p>
<p>The way that we have subdivided the Kitaev model into vortex sectors,
we have a neat separation beween vortices and fermionic excitations.
However if we looked at the full many body picture we would see that a
vortex caries with it a cloud of bound majorana states.</p>

this to get from the <span class="math inline">\((\Phi_x, \Phi_y) = (+1,

<p>However in the non-Abelian phase we have to wrangle with
monodromy<span class="citation"

role="doc-biblioref">3</a>,<a
href="#ref-oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. Monodromy is behaviour of
objects as they move around a singularity. This manifests here in that
the identity of a vortex and cloud of Majoranas can change as we wind
them around the torus in such a way that rather than anhilating to the
vacuum the anhilate to create an excited state instead of a ground
state. This means we end up with only three degenerate ground states in
the non-Abelian phase <span class="math inline">\((+1, +1), (+1, -1),
(-1, +1)\)</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010"><sup><a
href="#ref-chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span>. The way that this shows up
concretly is that the projector enforces both flux and fermion parity.
When we wind a vortex around both non-contractible loops of the torus,
it flips the flux parity which forces means we have to introduce a
fermionic excitation to make the state physical. Hence the process does
not give a fourth ground state.</p>

alt="(Bond Sector) A state in the bond sector is specified by assigning \pm 1 to each edge of the lattice. However this description has a substantial gauge degeneracy. We can simplfy things by decomposing each state into the product of three kinds of objects: (Vortex Sector) Only a small number of bonds need to be flipped (compared to some arbitrary reference) to reconstruct the vortex sector. The edges here are chosen from a spanning tree of the dual lattice, so there are no loops. (Gauge Field) The ‘loopiness’ of the bond sector can be factored out giving a network of loops that can always be written as a product the of the gauge operators D_j. (Topolical Sector) Finally there are two loops that have no effect on the vortex sector, nor can they be constructed from gauge symmetries. These can be thought of as two fluxes \Phi_{x/y} that thread through the major and minor axes of the torus. Measuring \Phi_{x/y} corresponds to constructing Wilson loops around the axes of the torus. We can flip the value of \Phi_{x} by transporting a vortex pair around the torus in the y direction and that is what is shown here. In each of the three figures on the right, black bonds correspond to those that must be flipped, composing the three together gives back the original bond sector on the left." /></p>
<p>One reason the topology has gained interest recently is there have
proposals to use this ground state degeneracy to implement both
passively fault tolerant and actively stabilised quantum computations
