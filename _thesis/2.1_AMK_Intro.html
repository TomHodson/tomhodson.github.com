<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Kitaev-Honeycomb model is remarkable because it was the first
such model that combined three key properties.</p>
<p>First, it is a plausible tight binding Hamiltonian. The form of the
Hamiltonian could be realised by a real material. Indeed candidate
materials such as <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\mathrm{-RuCl}_3\)</span> were quickly
found<span class="citation"
data-cites="banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016 trebstKitaevMaterials2022"><sup><a
href="#ref-banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-trebstKitaevMaterials2022"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span> that are expected to behave
according to the Kitaev with small corrections.</p>
<p>Second, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is deeply interesting to modern
condensed matter theory. Its ground state is almost the canonical
example of the long sought after quantum spin liquid state. Its
excitations are anyons, particles that can only exist in two dimensions
that break the normal fermion/boson dichotomy. Anyons have been the
subject of much attention because, among other reasons, there are
proposals to braid them through space and time to achieve noise tolerant
quantum computations<span class="citation"
data-cites="freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"><sup><a
href="#ref-freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Third and perhaps most importantly, it a rare many body interacting
quantum system that can be treated analytically. It is exactly
solveable. We can explicitly write down its many body ground states in
terms of single particle states<span class="citation"
data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"><sup><a
href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. Its solubility comes about
because the model has extensively many conserved degrees of freedom that
mediate the interactions between quantum degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will discuss the physics of the Kitaev Model on
amorphous lattices.</p>
<p>I’ll start by discussing the physics of the Kitaev model in much more
detail. Here I will look at the gauge symmetries of the model as well as
its solution via a transformation to a Majorana hamiltonian. From this
discusssion we will see that for the the model to be sovleable it need
only be defined on a trivalent, tri-edge-colourable lattice<span
class="citation" data-cites="Nussinov2009"><sup><a
href="#ref-Nussinov2009" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>In the methods section, I will discuss how to generate such lattices
and colour them as well as how to map back and forth between
configurations of the gauge field and configurations of the gauge
invariant quantities.</p>
<p>In results section, I will begin by looking at the zero temperature
physics. I’ll present numerical evidence that the ground state of the
model is given by a simple rule. I’ll make an assessment of the gapless,
abelian and non-abelian phases that are present as well as spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking and topological edge states. We will also
compare the zero temperature phase diagram to that of the Kitaev
Honeycomb Model. Next I will take the model to finite temperature and
demonstrate that there is a phase transition to a thermal metal
state.</p>
<p>In the Discussion I will consider possible physical realisations of
this model as well the motivations for doing so. I will alao discuss how
a well known quantum error correcting code defined on the Kitaev
Honeycomb could be generalised to the amorphous case.</p>
<p>Various generalisations have been made, one mode replaces pairs of
hexagons with heptagons and pentagons and another that replaces vertices
of the hexagons with triangles . When we generalise this to the
amorphous case, the key property that will remain is that each vertex
interacts with exactly three others via an x, y and z edge. However the
lattice will no longer be bipartite, breaking chiral symmetry among
other things.</p>
<p>Kitaev-Heisenberg Model In real materials there will generally be an
addtional small Heisenberg term <span class="math display">\[H_{KH} =  -
\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha} +
\sigma_j\sigma_k\]</span></p>

case is intersting</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-kitaev-model">The Kitaev Model</h2>
<h3 id="commutation-relations">Commutation relations</h3>
<p>Before diving into the Hamiltonian of the Kitaev Model, here is a
quick refresher of the key commutation relations of spins, fermions and
Majoranas.</p>
<h4 id="spins">Spins</h4>
<p>Skip this is you’re super familiar with the algebra of the Pauli
martrices. Scalars like <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ij}\)</span>
should be understood to be multiplied by an implicit identity <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{1}\)</span> where necessary.</p>
<p>We can represent a single spin<span
class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span> particle using the Pauli matrices
<span class="math inline">\((\sigma^x, \sigma^y, \sigma^z) =
\vec{\sigma}\)</span>, these matrices all square to the identity <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\alpha = \mathbb{1}\)</span>
and obey nice commutation and exchange rules: <span
class="math display">\[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta = \delta^{\alpha
\beta} + i \epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[[\sigma^\alpha, \sigma^\beta] = 2 i
\epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma\]</span></p>
<p>Adding a sites indices <span class="math inline">\(ijk...\)</span>,
spins at different spatial sites commute always <span
class="math inline">\([\vec{\sigma}_i, \vec{\sigma}_j] = 0\)</span> so
when <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\sigma_i^\alpha \sigma_j^\beta = \sigma_j^\alpha
\sigma_i^\beta\]</span> <span class="math display">\[[\sigma_i^\alpha,
\sigma_j^\beta] = 0\]</span> while the previous equations hold for <span
class="math inline">\(i = j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two extra relations that will be useful for the Kitaev model are the
value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta
\sigma^\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\sigma^\alpha
\sigma^\beta, \sigma^\gamma]\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma\)</span> these can
be computed quite easily by appling the above relations yielding: <span
class="math display">\[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta \sigma^\gamma = i
\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta, \sigma^\gamma] =
0\]</span></p>
<h4 id="fermions-and-majoranas">Fermions and Majoranas</h4>
<p>The fermionic creation and anhilation operators are defined by the
canonical anticommutation relations <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\{f_i, f_j\} &amp;= \{f^\dagger_i, f^\dagger_j\} = 0\\
\{f_i, f^\dagger_j\} &amp;= \delta_{ij}
\end{aligned}\]</span> which give us the exchange statistics and Pauli
exclusion principle.</p>
<p>From fermionic operators, we can construct Majorana operators: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_i         &amp;= 1/2 (a_i + ib_i)\\
f^\dagger_i &amp;= 1/2(a_i - ib_i)\\
a_i         &amp;= f_i + f^\dagger_i = 2\mathbb{R}f\\
b_i         &amp;= 1/i(f_i - f^\dagger_i) = 2\mathbb{I} f
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Majorana operators are the real and imaginary parts of the fermionic
operators, physically they correspond to the orthogonal superpositions
of the presence and absence of the fermion and are thus a kind of
quasiparticle.</p>
<p>Once we involve multiple fermions there is quite a bit of freedom in
how we can perform the transformation from <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> fermions <span
class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> Majoranas <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>. The property that must be preserved
however is that the Majoranas still anticommute:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{c_i, c_j\} =
2\delta_{ij}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="the-hamiltonian">The Hamiltonian</h3>
<p>To get down to brass tacks, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is a model of
interacting spin<span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span>s on the
vertices of a honeycomb lattice. Each bond in the lattice is assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \{ x, y, z\}\)</span> and
that bond couples its two spin neighbours along the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> axis. See fig. <a
href="#fig:visual_kitaev_1">1</a> for a diagram.</p>
<p>This gives us the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[H =  -
\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha_j\)</span> is a Pauli matrix acting
on site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha\)</span> is a pair of
nearest-neighbour indices connected by an <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-bond with exchange coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"><sup><a
href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. For notational brevity is is
useful to introduce the bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij} =
\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a function of <span
class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> that picks the correct bond type.</p>
<div id="fig:visual_kitaev_1" class="fignos">

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 1:</span> </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This Kitaev model has a set of conserved quantities that, in the spin
language, take the form of Wilson loop operators <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> winding around a closed path on the
lattice. The direction doesn’t matter, but I will stick to clockwise
here. I’ll use the term plaquette and the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to refer to a Wilson loop operator
that does not enclose any other sites, such as a single hexagon in a
honeycomb lattice.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_p = \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p}
K_{ij} = \sigma_1^z \sigma_2^x \sigma_2^y \sigma_3^y .. \sigma_n^y
\sigma_n^y \sigma_1^z\]</span></p>
<p><strong>add a diagram of a single plaquette with labelled site and
bond types</strong></p>
<p>In closed loops, each site appears twice in the product with two of
the three bond types. Applying <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha
\sigma^\beta = \epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma, \alpha \neq
\beta\)</span> then gives us a product containing a single pauli matrix
associated with each site in the loop with the type of the
<em>outward</em> pointing bond. From this we see that the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> associated with hexagons or shapes
with an even number of sides all square to 1 and hence have eigenvalues
<span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>A consequence of the fact that the honeycomb lattice is bipartite is
that there are no closed loops that contain an even number of edges<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and hence all the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> have eigenvalues <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> on bipartite lattices. Later we
will show that plaquettes with an odd number of sides (odd plaquettes
for short) will have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm
i\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 2:</span> The eigenvalues of

</figure>
</div>
<p>Remarkably, all of the spin bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> commute with all the Wilson loop
operators <span class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[[W_p, J_{ij}] = 0\]</span> We can prove this by
considering the three cases: 1. neither <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is part of the loop 2. one of <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are part of the loop 3. both are part
of the loop</p>
<p>The first case is trivial while the other two require a bit of
algebra, outlined in fig. <a href="#fig:visual_kitaev_2">3</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Since the Hamiltonian is just a linear combination of bond operators,
it also commutes with the plaquette operators! This is great because it
means that the there’s a simultaneous eigenbasis for the Hamiltonian and
the plaquette operators. We can thus work in a basis in which the
eigenvalues of the plaquette operators take on a definite value and for
all intents and purposes act like classical degrees of freedom. These
are the extensively many conserved quantities that make the model
tractable.</p>
<p>Plaquette operators measure flux. We will find that the ground state
of the model corresponds to some particular choice of flux through each
plaquette. I will refer to excitations which flip the expectation value
of a plaqutte operator away from the ground state as
<strong>vortices</strong>.</p>
<p>Fixing a configuration of the vortices thus partitions the many-body
Hilbert space into a set of ‘vortex sectors’ labelled by that particular
flux configuration <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i = \pm 1,\pm
i\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="from-spins-to-majorana-operators">From Spins to Majorana
operators</h3>
<h4 id="for-a-single-spin">For a single spin</h4>
<p>Let’s start by considering just one site and its <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^x, \sigma^y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^z\)</span> operators which live in a two
dimensional Hilbert space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will introduce two fermionic modes <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> that satisy the canonical
anticommutation relations along with their number operators <span
class="math inline">\(n_f = f^\dagger f, n_g = g^\dagger g\)</span> and
the total fermionic parity operator <span class="math inline">\(F_p =
(2n_f - 1)(2n_g - 1)\)</span> which we can use to divide their Fock
space up into even and odd parity subspaces which are separated by the
addition or removal of one fermion.</p>
<p>From these two fermionic modes we can build four Majorana operators:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
b^x &amp;= f + f^\dagger\\
b^y &amp;= -i(f - f^\dagger)\\
b^z &amp;= g + g^\dagger\\
c   &amp;= -i(g - g^\dagger)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The Majoranas obey the usual commutation relations, squaring to one
and anticommuting with eachother. The fermions and Majorana live in a 4
dimenional Fock space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>. We can therefore
identify the two dimensional space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> with one of the partity
subspaces of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>
which we will call the <em>physical subspace</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}_p\)</span>. Kitaev defines the
operator <span class="math display">\[D = b^xb^yb^zc\]</span> which can
be expanded out to <span class="math display">\[D = -(2n_f - 1)(2n_g -
1) = -F_p\]</span> and labels the physical subspace as the space sanned
by states for which <span class="math display">\[ D|\phi\rangle =
|\phi\rangle\]</span></p>
<p>We can also think of the physical subspace as whatever is left after
applying the projector <span class="math display">\[P  = \frac{1 -
D}{2}\]</span> to it. This formulation will be useful for taking states
that span the extended space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{M}}\)</span> and projecting them
into the physical subspace.</p>
<p>So now, with the caveat that we are working in the physical subspace,
we can define new pauli operators:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^x = i b^x c,\;
\tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c,\; \tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c\]</span></p>
<p>These extended space pauli operators satisfy all the usual
commutation relations, the only difference being that if we evaluate
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^x \sigma^y \sigma^z = i\)</span> we
instead get <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\sigma}^x\tilde{\sigma}^y\tilde{\sigma}^z = iD \]</span></p>
<p>Which indeed makes sense, as long as we promise to confine ourselves
to the physical subspace <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span> and
this all makes sense.</p>

<h4 id="for-multiple-spins">For multiple spins</h4>
<p>This construction generalises easily to the case of multiple spins:
we get a set of 4 Majoranas <span class="math inline">\(b^x_j,\;
b^y_j,\;b^z_j,\; c_j\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(D_j =
b^x_jb^y_jb^z_jc_j\)</span> operator for every spin. For a state to be
physical we require that <span class="math inline">\(D_j |\psi\rangle =
|\psi\rangle\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>From these each Pauli operator can be constructed: <span
class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^\alpha_j = i b^\alpha_j
c_j\]</span></p>
<p>This is where the magic happens. We can promote the spin hamiltonian
from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> into the extended
space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>, safe in
the knowledge that nothing changes so long as we only actually work with
physical states. The Hamiltonian <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{H} &amp;=  - \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_j^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_k^{\alpha}\\
          &amp;= \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
2J^{\alpha} (ib^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j) c_i c_j\\
          &amp;=  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha}
2J^{\alpha} \hat{u}_{ij} \hat{c}_i \hat{c}_j
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can factor out the Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij} = i b^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j\)</span>.
Note that these bond operators are not equal to the spin bond operators
<span class="math inline">\(K_{ij} = \sigma^\alpha_i \sigma^\alpha_j = -
\hat{u}_{ij} c_i c_j\)</span>. In what follows we will work much more
frequently with the Majorana bond operators so when I refer to bond
operators without qualification, I am refering to the Majorana
variety.</p>
<p>Similar to the argument with the spin bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> we can quickly verify by
considering three cases that the Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> all commute with one another. They
square to one so have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm
1\)</span> and they also commute with the <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>Another important point here is that the operators <span
class="math inline">\(D_i = b^x_i b^y_i b^z_i c_i\)</span> commute with
<span class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> and therefore with <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}\)</span>. We will show later that the
action of <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> on a state is to flip
the values of the three <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>
bonds that connect to site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
Physcially this is telling us that <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> is a gauge field with a high
degree of degeneracy.</p>
<p>In summary Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are an emergent, classical, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z_2}\)</span> gauge field!</p>
<h3 id="partitioning-the-hilbert-space-into-bond-sectors">Partitioning
the Hilbert Space into Bond sectors</h3>
<p>Similar to the story with the plaquette operators from the spin
language, we can break the Hilbert space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> up into sectors labelled by
the a set of choices <span class="math inline">\(\{\pm 1\}\)</span> for
the value of each <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> operator
which I denote by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>.
Since <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = -u_{ji}\)</span> we can
represent the <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> graphically
with an arrow that points along each bond in the direction in which
<span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Once confined to a particular <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>, we can ‘remove the hats’
from the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij}\)</span> and the
hamiltonian becomes a quadratic, free fermion problem <span
class="math display">\[\tilde{H_u} =  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle
i,j\rangle_\alpha} 2J^{\alpha} u_{ij} c_i c_j\]</span> the ground state
of which, <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_u\rangle\)</span> can be
found easily via matrix diagonalisation. If you have been paying very
close attention, you may at this point ask whether the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span> are confined entirely
within the physical subspace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_p\)</span> and indeed we will see that
they are not. However it will be helpful to first develop the theory of
the Majorana Hamiltonian a little more.</p>

<h2 id="the-majorana-hamiltonian">The Majorana Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>We now have a quadtratic hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{H} =  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha} 2J^{\alpha}
u_{ij} c_i c_j\]</span> in which most of the Majorana degrees of freedom
have paired along bonds to become a classical gauge field <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>. What follows is relatively
standard theory for quadratic Majorana Hamiltonians<span
class="citation" data-cites="BlaizotRipka1986"><sup><a
href="#ref-BlaizotRipka1986"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the the antisymmetry of the matrix with entries
<span class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>, the eigenvalues
of the Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span> come
in pairs <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span>. This
redundant information is a consequence of the doubling of the Hilbert
space which occured when we transformed to the Majorana
representation.</p>
<p>If we pair organise the eigenmodes of <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> into pairs such that <span
class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b_m&#39;\)</span> have energies <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-\epsilon_m\)</span> we can construct the
transformation <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[(c_1, c_2... c_{2N}) Q = (b_1, b_1&#39;, b_2,
b_2&#39; ... b_{N}, b_{N}&#39;)\]</span> and put the Hamiltonian into
the form <span class="math display">\[\tilde{H}_u = \frac{i}{2} \sum_m
\epsilon_m b_m b_m&#39;\]</span></p>
<p>The determinant of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> will be
useful later when we consider the projector from <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> but otherwise the <span
class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> are just an intermediate step. From
them we form fermionic operators <span class="math display">\[ f_i =
\tfrac{1}{2} (b_m + ib_m&#39;)\]</span> with their associated number
operators <span class="math inline">\(n_i = f^\dagger_i f_i\)</span>.
These let us write the Hamiltonian neatly as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_u = \sum_m \epsilon_m (n_m -
\tfrac{1}{2}).\]</span></p>
<p>The ground state <span class="math inline">\(|n_m = 0\rangle\)</span>
of the many body system at fixed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>
is then <span class="math display">\[E_{u,0} = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_m
\epsilon_m \]</span> and we can construct any state from a particular
choice of <span class="math inline">\(n_m = 0,1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In cases where all we care about it the value of <span
class="math inline">\(E_{u,0}\)</span> it is possible to skip forming
the fermionic operators. The eigenvalues obtained directly from
diagonalising <span class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>
come in <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span> pairs. We
can take half the absolute value of the whole set to recover <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_m \epsilon_m\)</span> easily.</p>
<p><strong>The Majorana Hamiltonian is quadratic within a Bond
Sector.</strong></p>
<h3 id="mapping-back-from-bond-sectors-to-the-physical-subspace">Mapping
back from Bond Sectors to the Physical Subspace</h3>
<p>At this point, given a particular bond configuration <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = \pm 1\)</span> we are able to construct a
quadratic Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span>
in the extended space and diagonalise it to find its ground state <span
class="math inline">\(|\vec{u}, \vec{n} = 0\rangle\)</span>. This is not
necessarily the ground state of the system as a whole, it just the
lowest energy state within the subspace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span></p>
<p><strong>However, <span class="math inline">\(|u, n_m =
0\rangle\)</span> does not lie in the physical subspace</strong>. As an
example let’s take the lowest energy state associated with <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = +1\)</span>, this state satisfies <span
class="math display">\[u_{ij} |\vec{u}=1, \vec{n} = 0\rangle =
|\vec{u}=1, \vec{n} = 0\rangle\]</span> for all bonds <span
class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we act on it this state with one of the gauge operators <span
class="math inline">\(D_j = b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z c_j\)</span> we see that
<span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> flips the value of the three
bonds <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> that surround site
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ |u&#39;\rangle = D_j |u=1, n_m =
0\rangle\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
\langle u&#39;|u_{ij}|u&#39;\rangle &amp;=  \langle u| b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z
c_j \;ib^x_i b^x_j\; b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z c_j|u\rangle\\
&amp;= -1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> commutes with the
hamiltonian in the extended space <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}\)</span>, the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> flips the value of bond operators is
telling us that there is a gauge degeneracy between the ground state of
<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span> and the set of <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_{u&#39;}\)</span> related to it by gauge
transformations <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>. I.e we can
flip any three bonds around a vertex and the physics will stay the
same.</p>
<p>We can turn this into a symmetrisation procedure by taking a
superposition of every possible gauge transformation. Every possible
gauge transformation is just every possible subset of <span
class="math inline">\({D_0, D_1 ... D_n}\)</span> which can be neatly
expressed as <span class="math display">\[|\phi_w\rangle = \prod_i
\left( \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\right) |\tilde{\phi}_u\rangle\]</span> this is
nice because the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1 +
D_i}{2}\)</span> is also the local projector onto the physical subspace.
Here <span class="math inline">\(|\phi_w\rangle\)</span> is a gauge
invariant state that lives in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_p\)</span> which has been constructed
from a set of states in different <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gauge degeneracy leads nicely onto the next topic which is how
to construct a set of gauge invariant quantities out of the <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>, these will turn out to just be
the plaquette operators.</p>
<p><strong>The Bond Sectors overlap with the physical subspace but are
not contained within it.</strong></p>
<h3 id="open-boundary-conditions">Open boundary conditions</h3>
<p>Care must be taken in the definition of open boundary conditions.
Simply removing bonds from the lattice leaves behind unpaired <span
class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators that need to be paired
in some way to arrive at fermionic modes. In order to fix a pairing we
always start from a lattice defined on the torus and generate a lattice
with open boundary conditions by defining the bond coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha}_{ij} = 0\)</span> for sites joined by
bonds <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> that we want to remove.
This creates fermionic zero modes <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> associated with these cut bonds
which we set to 1 when calculating the projector.</p>
<p>Alternatively, since all the fermionic zero modes are degenerate
anyway, an arbitrary pairing of the unpaired <span
class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators could be performed.
<strong>Is is possible that a lattice constructed and coloured like this
would have unequal numbers of <span class="math inline">\(b^x\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(b^y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b^z\)</span> operators?</strong></p>
