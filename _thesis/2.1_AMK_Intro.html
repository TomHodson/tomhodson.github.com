<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Kitaev-Honeycomb model is remarkable because it was the first
such model that combined three key properties.</p>
<p>First, it is a plausible tight binding Hamiltonian. The form of the
Hamiltonian could be realised by a real material. Indeed candidate
materials such as <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\mathrm{-RuCl}_3\)</span> were quickly
found<span class="citation"
data-cites="banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016 trebstKitaevMaterials2022"><sup><a
href="#ref-banerjeeProximateKitaevQuantum2016"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-trebstKitaevMaterials2022"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span> that are expected to behave
according to the Kitaev with small corrections.</p>
<p>Second, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is deeply interesting to modern
condensed matter theory. Its ground state is almost the canonical
example of the long sought after quantum spin liquid state. Its
excitations are anyons, particles that can only exist in two dimensions
that break the normal fermion/boson dichotomy. Anyons have been the
subject of much attention because, among other reasons, there are
proposals to braid them through space and time to achieve noise tolerant
quantum computations<span class="citation"
data-cites="freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"><sup><a
href="#ref-freedmanTopologicalQuantumComputation2003"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Third and perhaps most importantly, it a rare many body interacting
quantum system that can be treated analytically. It is exactly
solveable. We can explicitly write down its many body ground states in
terms of single particle states<span class="citation"
data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"><sup><a
href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. Its solubility comes about
because the model has extensively many conserved degrees of freedom that
mediate the interactions between quantum degrees of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Insert discussion of why a generalisation to the amorphous
case is intersting</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-outline">Chapter outline</h2>
<p>In this chapter I will discuss the physics of the Kitaev Model on
amorphous lattices.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll start by discussing the physics of the Kitaev model in much more
detail. Here I will look at the gauge symmetries of the model as well as
its solution via a transformation to a Majorana hamiltonian. From this
discusssion we will see that for the the model to be sovleable it need
only be defined on a trivalent, tri-edge-colourable lattice<span
class="citation" data-cites="Nussinov2009"><sup><a
href="#ref-Nussinov2009" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>In the methods section, I will discuss how to generate such lattices
and colour them as well as how to map back and forth between
configurations of the gauge field and configurations of the gauge
invariant quantities.</p>
<p>In results section, I will begin by looking at the zero temperature
physics. Iâ€™ll present numerical evidence that the ground state of the
model is given by a simple rule. Iâ€™ll make an assessment of the gapless,
abelian and non-abelian phases that are present as well as spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking and topological edge states. We will also
compare the zero temperature phase diagram to that of the Kitaev
Honeycomb Model. Next I will take the model to finite temperature and
demonstrate that there is a phase transition to a thermal metal
state.</p>
<p>In the Discussion I will consider possible physical realisations of
this model as well the motivations for doing so. I will alao discuss how
a well known quantum error correcting code defined on the Kitaev
Honeycomb could be generalised to the amorphous case.</p>
<p>Various generalisations have been made, one mode replaces pairs of
hexagons with heptagons and pentagons and another that replaces vertices
of the hexagons with triangles . When we generalise this to the
amorphous case, the key property that will remain is that each vertex
interacts with exactly three others via an x, y and z edge. However the
lattice will no longer be bipartite, breaking chiral symmetry among
other things.</p>
<h2 id="kitaev-heisenberg-model">Kitaev-Heisenberg Model</h2>
<p>In real materials there will generally be an addtional small
Heisenberg term <span class="math display">\[H_{KH} =  - \sum_{\langle
j,k\rangle_\alpha} J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha} +
\sigma_j\sigma_k\]</span></p>
<h1 id="an-in-depth-look-at-the-kitaev-model">An in-depth look at the
Kitaev Model</h1>
<h2 id="commutation-relations">Commutation relations</h2>
<p>Before diving into the Hamiltonian of the Kitaev Model, here is a
quick refresher of the key commutation relations of spins, fermions and
Majoranas.</p>
<h3 id="spins">Spins</h3>
<p>Skip this is youâ€™re super familiar with the algebra of the Pauli
martrices. Scalars like <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{ij}\)</span>
should be understood to be multiplied by an implicit identity <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{1}\)</span> where necessary.</p>
<p>We can represent a single spin<span
class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span> particle using the Pauli matrices
<span class="math inline">\((\sigma^x, \sigma^y, \sigma^z) =
\vec{\sigma}\)</span>, these matrices all square to the identity <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\alpha = \mathbb{1}\)</span>
and obey nice commutation and exchange rules: <span
class="math display">\[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta = \delta^{\alpha
\beta} + i \epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[[\sigma^\alpha, \sigma^\beta] = 2 i
\epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma\]</span></p>
<p>Adding a sites indices <span class="math inline">\(ijk...\)</span>,
spins at different spatial sites commute always <span
class="math inline">\([\vec{\sigma}_i, \vec{\sigma}_j] = 0\)</span> so
when <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\sigma_i^\alpha \sigma_j^\beta = \sigma_j^\alpha
\sigma_i^\beta\]</span> <span class="math display">\[[\sigma_i^\alpha,
\sigma_j^\beta] = 0\]</span> while the previous equations hold for <span
class="math inline">\(i = j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two extra relations that will be useful for the Kitaev model are the
value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta
\sigma^\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([\sigma^\alpha
\sigma^\beta, \sigma^\gamma]\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma\)</span> these can
be computed quite easily by appling the above relations yielding: <span
class="math display">\[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta \sigma^\gamma = i
\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[[\sigma^\alpha \sigma^\beta, \sigma^\gamma] =
0\]</span></p>
<h3 id="fermions-and-majoranas">Fermions and Majoranas</h3>
<p>The fermionic creation and anhilation operators are defined by the
canonical anticommutation relations <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\{f_i, f_j\} &amp;= \{f^\dagger_i, f^\dagger_j\} = 0\\
\{f_i, f^\dagger_j\} &amp;= \delta_{ij}
\end{aligned}\]</span> which give us the exchange statistics and Pauli
exclusion principle.</p>
<p>From fermionic operators, we can construct Majorana operators: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_i         &amp;= 1/2 (a_i + ib_i)\\
f^\dagger_i &amp;= 1/2(a_i - ib_i)\\
a_i         &amp;= f_i + f^\dagger_i = 2\mathbb{R}f\\
b_i         &amp;= 1/i(f_i - f^\dagger_i) = 2\mathbb{I} f
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Majorana operators are the real and imaginary parts of the fermionic
operators, physically they correspond to the orthogonal superpositions
of the presence and absence of the fermion and are thus a kind of
quasiparticle.</p>
<p>Once we involve multiple fermions there is quite a bit of freedom in
how we can perform the transformation from <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> fermions <span
class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(2n\)</span> Majoranas <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>. The property that must be preserved
however is that the Majoranas still anticommute:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{c_i, c_j\} =
2\delta_{ij}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="the-hamiltonian">The Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>To get down to brass tacks, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is a model of
interacting spin<span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span>s on the
vertices of a honeycomb lattice. Each bond in the lattice is assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \{ x, y, z\}\)</span> and
that bond couples its two spin neighbours along the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> axis. See fig.Â <a
href="#fig:visual_kitaev_1">1</a> for a diagram.</p>
<p>This gives us the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[H =  -
\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha_j\)</span> is a Pauli matrix acting
on site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha\)</span> is a pair of
nearest-neighbour indices connected by an <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-bond with exchange coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"><sup><a
href="#ref-kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. For notational brevity is is
useful to introduce the bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij} =
\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a function of <span
class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> that picks the correct bond type.</p>

</div>
<p>This Kitaev model has a set of conserved quantities that, in the spin
language, take the form of Wilson loop operators <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> winding around a closed path on the
lattice. The direction doesnâ€™t matter, but I will stick to clockwise
here. Iâ€™ll use the term plaquette and the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to refer to a Wilson loop operator
that does not enclose any other sites, such as a single hexagon in a
honeycomb lattice.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_p = \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p}
K_{ij} = \sigma_1^z \sigma_2^x \sigma_2^y \sigma_3^y .. \sigma_n^y
\sigma_n^y \sigma_1^z\]</span></p>
<p><strong>add a diagram of a single plaquette with labelled site and
bond types</strong></p>
<p>In closed loops, each site appears twice in the product with two of
the three bond types. Applying <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha
\sigma^\beta = \epsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma} \sigma^\gamma, \alpha \neq
\beta\)</span> then gives us a product containing a single pauli matrix
associated with each site in the loop with the type of the
<em>outward</em> pointing bond. From this we see that the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> associated with hexagons or shapes
with an even number of sides all square to 1 and hence have eigenvalues
<span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>A consequence of the fact that the honeycomb lattice is bipartite is
that there are no closed loops that contain an even number of edges<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and hence all the <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> have eigenvalues <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> on bipartite lattices. Later we
will show that plaquettes with an odd number of sides (odd plaquettes
for short) will have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm
i\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>FigureÂ 2:</span> The eigenvalues of
a loop or plaquette operators depend on how many bonds in its enclosing

</figure>
</div>
<p>Remarkably, all of the spin bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> commute with all the Wilson loop
operators <span class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[[W_p, J_{ij}] = 0\]</span> We can prove this by
considering the three cases: 1. neither <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is part of the loop 2. one of <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are part of the loop 3. both are part
of the loop</p>
<p>The first case is trivial while the other two require a bit of
algebra, outlined in fig.Â <a href="#fig:visual_kitaev_2">3</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Since the Hamiltonian is just a linear combination of bond operators,
it also commutes with the plaquette operators! This is great because it
means that the thereâ€™s a simultaneous eigenbasis for the Hamiltonian and
the plaquette operators. We can thus work in a basis in which the
eigenvalues of the plaquette operators take on a definite value and for
all intents and purposes act like classical degrees of freedom. These
are the extensively many conserved quantities that make the model
tractable.</p>
<p>Plaquette operators measure flux. We will find that the ground state
of the model corresponds to some particular choice of flux through each
plaquette. I will refer to excitations which flip the expectation value
of a plaqutte operator away from the ground state as
<strong>vortices</strong>.</p>
<p>Fixing a configuration of the vortices thus partitions the many-body
Hilbert space into a set of â€˜vortex sectorsâ€™ labelled by that particular
flux configuration <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i = \pm 1,\pm
i\)</span>.</p>

class="math inline">\(\sigma^x, \sigma^y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^z\)</span> operators which live in a two
dimensional Hilbert space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will introduce two fermionic modes <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> that satisy the canonical
anticommutation relations along with their number operators <span
class="math inline">\(n_f = f^\dagger f, n_g = g^\dagger g\)</span> and
the total fermionic parity operator <span class="math inline">\(F_p =
(2n_f - 1)(2n_g - 1)\)</span> which we can use to divide their Fock
space up into even and odd parity subspaces which are separated by the
addition or removal of one fermion.</p>
<p>From these two fermionic modes we can build four Majorana operators:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
b^x &amp;= f + f^\dagger\\
b^y &amp;= -i(f - f^\dagger)\\
b^z &amp;= g + g^\dagger\\
c   &amp;= -i(g - g^\dagger)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The Majoranas obey the usual commutation relations, squaring to one
and anticommuting with eachother. The fermions and Majorana live in a 4
dimenional Fock space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>. We can therefore
identify the two dimensional space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> with one of the partity
subspaces of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>
which we will call the <em>physical subspace</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}_p\)</span>. Kitaev defines the
operator <span class="math display">\[D = b^xb^yb^zc\]</span> which can
be expanded out to <span class="math display">\[D = -(2n_f - 1)(2n_g -
1) = -F_p\]</span> and labels the physical subspace as the space sanned
by states for which <span class="math display">\[ D|\phi\rangle =
|\phi\rangle\]</span></p>
<p>We can also think of the physical subspace as whatever is left after
applying the projector <span class="math display">\[P  = \frac{1 -
D}{2}\]</span> to it. This formulation will be useful for taking states
that span the extended space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{M}}\)</span> and projecting them
into the physical subspace.</p>
<p>So now, with the caveat that we are working in the physical subspace,
we can define new pauli operators:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^x = i b^x c,\;
\tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c,\; \tilde{\sigma}^y = i b^y c\]</span></p>
<p>These extended space pauli operators satisfy all the usual
commutation relations, the only difference being that if we evaluate
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^x \sigma^y \sigma^z = i\)</span> we
instead get <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\sigma}^x\tilde{\sigma}^y\tilde{\sigma}^z = iD \]</span></p>
<p>Which indeed makes sense, as long as we promise to confine ourselves
to the physical subspace <span class="math inline">\(D = 1\)</span> and
this all makes sense.</p>

<h3 id="for-multiple-spins">For multiple spins</h3>
<p>This construction generalises easily to the case of multiple spins:
we get a set of 4 Majoranas <span class="math inline">\(b^x_j,\;
b^y_j,\;b^z_j,\; c_j\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(D_j =
b^x_jb^y_jb^z_jc_j\)</span> operator for every spin. For a state to be
physical we require that <span class="math inline">\(D_j |\psi\rangle =
|\psi\rangle\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>From these each Pauli operator can be constructed: <span
class="math display">\[\tilde{\sigma}^\alpha_j = i b^\alpha_j
c_j\]</span></p>
<p>This is where the magic happens. We can promote the spin hamiltonian
from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> into the extended
space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span>, safe in
the knowledge that nothing changes so long as we only actually work with
physical states. The Hamiltonian <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{H} &amp;=  - \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_j^{\alpha}\tilde{\sigma}_k^{\alpha}\\
          &amp;= \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
2J^{\alpha} (ib^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j) c_i c_j\\
          &amp;=  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha}
2J^{\alpha} \hat{u}_{ij} \hat{c}_i \hat{c}_j
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We can factor out the Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij} = i b^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j\)</span>.
Note that these bond operators are not equal to the spin bond operators
<span class="math inline">\(K_{ij} = \sigma^\alpha_i \sigma^\alpha_j = -
\hat{u}_{ij} c_i c_j\)</span>. In what follows we will work much more
frequently with the Majorana bond operators so when I refer to bond
operators without qualification, I am refering to the Majorana
variety.</p>
<p>Similar to the argument with the spin bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> we can quickly verify by
considering three cases that the Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> all commute with one another. They
square to one so have eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm
1\)</span> and they also commute with the <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators.</p>
<p>Another important point here is that the operators <span
class="math inline">\(D_i = b^x_i b^y_i b^z_i c_i\)</span> commute with
<span class="math inline">\(K_{ij}\)</span> and therefore with <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}\)</span>. We will show later that the
action of <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> on a state is to flip
the values of the three <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>
bonds that connect to site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
Physcially this is telling us that <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> is a gauge field with a high
degree of degeneracy.</p>
<p>In summary Majorana bond operators <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are an emergent, classical, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z_2}\)</span> gauge field!</p>
<h2 id="partitioning-the-hilbert-space-into-bond-sectors">Partitioning
the Hilbert Space into Bond sectors</h2>
<p>Similar to the story with the plaquette operators from the spin
language, we can break the Hilbert space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> up into sectors labelled by
the a set of choices <span class="math inline">\(\{\pm 1\}\)</span> for
the value of each <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> operator
which I denote by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>.
Since <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = -u_{ji}\)</span> we can
represent the <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> graphically
with an arrow that points along each bond in the direction in which
<span class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Once confined to a particular <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>, we can â€˜remove the hatsâ€™
from the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{u}_{ij}\)</span> and the
hamiltonian becomes a quadratic, free fermion problem <span
class="math display">\[\tilde{H_u} =  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle
i,j\rangle_\alpha} 2J^{\alpha} u_{ij} c_i c_j\]</span> the ground state
of which, <span class="math inline">\(|\psi_u\rangle\)</span> can be
found easily via matrix diagonalisation. If you have been paying very
close attention, you may at this point ask whether the <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span> are confined entirely
within the physical subspace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_p\)</span> and indeed we will see that
they are not. However it will be helpful to first develop the theory of
the Majorana Hamiltonian a little more.</p>

<h2 id="the-majorana-hamiltonian">The Majorana Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>We now have a quadtratic hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{H} =  \frac{i}{4} \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle_\alpha} 2J^{\alpha}
u_{ij} c_i c_j\]</span> in which most of the Majorana degrees of freedom
have paired along bonds to become a classical gauge field <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>. What follows is relatively
standard theory for quadratic Majorana Hamiltonians<span
class="citation" data-cites="BlaizotRipka1986"><sup><a
href="#ref-BlaizotRipka1986"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the the antisymmetry of the matrix with entries
<span class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>, the eigenvalues
of the Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span> come
in pairs <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span>. This
redundant information is a consequence of the doubling of the Hilbert
space which occured when we transformed to the Majorana
representation.</p>
<p>If we pair organise the eigenmodes of <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> into pairs such that <span
class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b_m&#39;\)</span> have energies <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-\epsilon_m\)</span> we can construct the
transformation <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[(c_1, c_2... c_{2N}) Q = (b_1, b_1&#39;, b_2,
b_2&#39; ... b_{N}, b_{N}&#39;)\]</span> and put the Hamiltonian into
the form <span class="math display">\[\tilde{H}_u = \frac{i}{2} \sum_m
\epsilon_m b_m b_m&#39;\]</span></p>
<p>The determinant of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> will be
useful later when we consider the projector from <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> but otherwise the <span
class="math inline">\(b_m\)</span> are just an intermediate step. From
them we form fermionic operators <span class="math display">\[ f_i =
\tfrac{1}{2} (b_m + ib_m&#39;)\]</span> with their associated number
operators <span class="math inline">\(n_i = f^\dagger_i f_i\)</span>.
These let us write the Hamiltonian neatly as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_u = \sum_m \epsilon_m (n_m -
\tfrac{1}{2}).\]</span></p>
<p>The ground state <span class="math inline">\(|n_m = 0\rangle\)</span>
of the many body system at fixed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>
is then <span class="math display">\[E_{u,0} = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_m
\epsilon_m \]</span> and we can construct any state from a particular
choice of <span class="math inline">\(n_m = 0,1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In cases where all we care about it the value of <span
class="math inline">\(E_{u,0}\)</span> it is possible to skip forming
the fermionic operators. The eigenvalues obtained directly from
diagonalising <span class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha} u_{ij}\)</span>
come in <span class="math inline">\(\pm \epsilon_m\)</span> pairs. We
can take half the absolute value of the whole set to recover <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_m \epsilon_m\)</span> easily.</p>
<p><strong>The Majorana Hamiltonian is quadratic within a Bond
Sector.</strong></p>
<h2 id="mapping-back-from-bond-sectors-to-the-physical-subspace">Mapping
back from Bond Sectors to the Physical Subspace</h2>
<p>At this point, given a particular bond configuration <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = \pm 1\)</span> we are able to construct a
quadratic Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span>
in the extended space and diagonalise it to find its ground state <span
class="math inline">\(|\vec{u}, \vec{n} = 0\rangle\)</span>. This is not
necessarily the ground state of the system as a whole, it just the
lowest energy state within the subspace <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span></p>
<p><strong>However, <span class="math inline">\(|u, n_m =
0\rangle\)</span> does not lie in the physical subspace</strong>. As an
example letâ€™s take the lowest energy state associated with <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij} = +1\)</span>, this state satisfies <span
class="math display">\[u_{ij} |\vec{u}=1, \vec{n} = 0\rangle =
|\vec{u}=1, \vec{n} = 0\rangle\]</span> for all bonds <span
class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we act on it this state with one of the gauge operators <span
class="math inline">\(D_j = b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z c_j\)</span> we see that
<span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> flips the value of the three
bonds <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> that surround site
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ |u&#39;\rangle = D_j |u=1, n_m =
0\rangle\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
\langle u&#39;|u_{ij}|u&#39;\rangle &amp;=  \langle u| b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z
c_j \;ib^x_i b^x_j\; b_j^x b_j^y b_j^z c_j|u\rangle\\
&amp;= -1
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> commutes with the
hamiltonian in the extended space <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}\)</span>, the fact that <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> flips the value of bond operators is
telling us that there is a gauge degeneracy between the ground state of
<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_u\)</span> and the set of <span
class="math inline">\(\tilde{H}_{u&#39;}\)</span> related to it by gauge
transformations <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>. I.e we can
flip any three bonds around a vertex and the physics will stay the
same.</p>
<p>We can turn this into a symmetrisation procedure by taking a
superposition of every possible gauge transformation. Every possible
gauge transformation is just every possible subset of <span
class="math inline">\({D_0, D_1 ... D_n}\)</span> which can be neatly
expressed as <span class="math display">\[|\phi_w\rangle = \prod_i
\left( \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\right) |\tilde{\phi}_u\rangle\]</span> this is
nice because the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1 +
D_i}{2}\)</span> is also the local projector onto the physical subspace.
Here <span class="math inline">\(|\phi_w\rangle\)</span> is a gauge
invariant state that lives in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_p\)</span> which has been constructed
from a set of states in different <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_u\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gauge degeneracy leads nicely onto the next topic which is how
to construct a set of gauge invariant quantities out of the <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span>, these will turn out to just be
the plaquette operators.</p>
<p><strong>The Bond Sectors overlap with the physical subspace but are
not contained within it.</strong></p>
<h2 id="properties-of-the-gauge-field">Properties of the Gauge
Field</h2>
<p>The bond operators <span class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> are
useful because they label a bond sector <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{\tilde{L}}_u\)</span> in which we can
easiy solve the Hamiltonian. However the gauge operators move us between
bond sectors. <strong>Bond sectors are not gauge invariant!</strong></p>
<p>Letâ€™s consider instead the properties of the plaquette operators
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\phi}_i\)</span> that live on the faces
of the lattice.</p>
<p>We already showed that they are conserved. And as one might hope and
expect, the plaquette operators map cleanly on to the bond operators of
the Majorana representation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\tilde{W}_p &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} \tilde{K}_{ij}\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p}
\tilde{\sigma}_i^\alpha \tilde{\sigma}_j^\alpha\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} (ib^\alpha_i
c_i)(ib^\alpha_j c_j)\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} i u_{ij} c_i c_j\\
            &amp;= \prod_{\mathrm{i,j}\; \in\; p} i u_{ij}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Where the last steps holds because each <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> appears exactly twice and adjacent to
its neighbour in each plaquette operator. Note that this is consistent
with the observation from earlier that each <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span> takes values <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> for even paths and <span
class="math inline">\(\pm i\)</span> for odd paths.</p>
<h3 id="vortices-and-their-movements">Vortices and their movements</h3>
<p>Letâ€™s imagine we started from the ground state of the model and
flipped the sign of a single bond. In doing so we will flip the sign of
the two plaquettes adjacent to that bond. Iâ€™ll call these disturbed
plaquettes <em>vortices</em>. Iâ€™ll refer to a particular choice values
for the plaquette operators as a vortex sector.</p>
<p>If we chain multiple bond flips we can create a pair of vortices at
arbitrary locations. The chain of bonds that we must flip corresponds to
a path on the dual of the lattice.</p>
<p>Something else we can do is create a pair of vortices, move one
around a loop and then anhilate it with its partner. This corresponds to
a closed loop on the dual lattice and applying such a bond flip leaves
the vortex sector unchanged.</p>
<p>Notice that the <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators
flip three bonds around a vertex. This is the smallest closed loop
around which one can move a vortex pair and anhilate it with itself.</p>
<p>Such operations compose in the sense that we can build any larger
loop by applying a series of <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
operations. Indeed the symetrisation procedure <span
class="math inline">\(\prod_i \left( \frac{1 + D_i}{2}\right)\)</span>
that maps from the bond sector to a physical state is applying
constructing a superposition over every such loop that leaves the vortex
sector unchanged.</p>
<p>The only loops that we cannot build out of <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>s are non-contractible loops, such as
those that span the major or minor circumference of the torus.</p>
<p><strong>The plaquette operators are the gauge invariant quantity that
determines the physics of the model</strong></p>

<p>Second it is now easy to show that the loops and plaquettes satisfy
nice composition rules, so long as we stick to loops that wind in a
particular direction.</p>
<p>Consider the product of two non-overlapping loops <span
class="math inline">\(W_a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(W_b\)</span> that share an edge <span
class="math inline">\(u_{12}\)</span>. Since the two loops both wind
clockwise and do not overlap, one will contain a term <span

square to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span

this for any number of shared edges. Hence, we get a version of Stokesâ€™
theorem: the product of <span class="math inline">\(i u_{jk}\)</span>
around any closed loop <span class="math inline">\(\partial A\)</span>
is equal to the product of plaquette operators <span

class="math inline">\(2^P\)</span>. However vortices can only be created
on pairs so there are really <span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{2^P}{2}
= 2^{P-1}\)</span> vortex sectors.</p>
<p>Gauge symmetries: As discussed earlier these correspond to the all
possible compositions of the <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
operators. Again there are only <span
class="math inline">\(2^{V-1}\)</span> of these because, as we will see
in the next section, <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j} D_j =
\mathbb{1}\)</span> in the physical space, and we enforce this by
chooising the correct product of single particle fermion states. You can
get an intuitive picture for why <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{j}
D_j = \mathbb{1}\)</span> by imagining larger and larger patches of
<span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators on the torus. These
patches correspond to transporting a vortex pair around the edge of the
patch. At some point the patch wraps around and starts to cover the
entire torus, as this happens the bounday of the patch disappears and
hence it which corresponds to the identity operation. See Fig ??
(animated in the HTML version).</p>
<p>Finally the torus has two non-contractible loop operators asscociated
with its major and minor diameters.</p>
<p>Putting this all together we see that there are <strong><span
class="math inline">\(2^B\)</span> bond sectors</strong> a space which
can be decomposed into the cartesian product of <strong><span
class="math inline">\(2^{P-1}\)</span> vortex sectors</strong>,
<strong><span class="math inline">\(2^{V-1}\)</span> gauge
symmetries</strong> and <strong><span class="math inline">\(2^2 =
4\)</span> topological sectors</strong> associated with the
non-contractible loop operators. This last factor forms the basis of
proposals to construct topologically protected qubits since the 4
sectors cold only be mixed by a highly non-local perturbation, ref

<h3 id="counting-edges-plaquettes-and-vertices">Counting edges,
plaquettes and vertices</h3>
<p>It will be useful to know how the trivalent structre of the lattice
constraints the number of bonds <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>,
plaquettes <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and vertices <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> it has.</p>
<p>We can immediately see that the lattice is built from vertices that
each share 3 edges with their neighbours. This means each vertex comes
with <span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{3}{2}\)</span> bonds i.e <span
class="math inline">\(3V = 2B\)</span>. This is consistent with the fact
that in the Majorana representation on the torus each vertex brings
three <span class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators which then
pair along bonds to give <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> bonds
per vertex.</p>
<p>If we define an integer <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(V = 2N\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B = 3N\)</span> and substitite this into the
polyhedra equation for the torus we see that <span
class="math inline">\(P = N\)</span>. So if is a trivalent lattice on
the torus has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes, it has
<span class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> bonds.</p>
<p>We can also consider the sum of the number of bonds in each plaquette
<span class="math inline">\(S_p\)</span>, since each bond is a member of
exactly two plaquettes <span class="math display">\[S_p = 2B =
6N\]</span></p>
<p>The mean size of a plaquette in a trivalent lattice on the torus is
exactly 6. Since the sum is even, this also tells us that all odd
plaquettes must come in pairs.</p>

<h2 id="the-projector">The Projector</h2>
<p>It will turn out that the projection from the extended space to the
physical space is not actually that important for the results that I
will present. However it it useful to go through the theory of it to
explain why this is.</p>
<p>The physicil states are defined as those for which <span
class="math inline">\(D_i |\phi\rangle = |\phi\rangle\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> has eigenvalues <span
class="math inline">\(\pm1\)</span>, the quantity <span
class="math inline">\(\tfrac{(1+D_i)}{2}\)</span> has eigenvalue <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for physical states and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for extended states so is the local
projector onto the physical subspace.</p>
<p>The global projector is therefore <span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{P} = \prod_{i=1}^{2N} \left( \frac{1 +
D_i}{2}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>for a toroidal trivalent lattice with <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> edges. As I pointed out before the
product over <span class="math inline">\((1 + D_j)\)</span> can also be
thought of as the sum of all possible subsets <span
class="math inline">\(\{i\}\)</span> of the <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators, which is the set of all
possible gauge symmetry operations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{2^{2N}}
\sum_{\{i\}} \prod_{i\in\{i\}} D_i\]</span></p>
<p>Since the gauge operators <span class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span>
commute and square to one, we can define the complement operator <span
class="math inline">\(C = \prod_{i=1}^{2N} D_i\)</span> and see that it
take each set of <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{i \in \{i\}}
D_j\)</span> operators and gives us the complement of that set. I said
earlier that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the identity in
the physical subspace and we will shortly see why.</p>
<p>W use the complement operator to rewrite the projector as a sum over
half the subsets <span class="math inline">\(\{\}\)</span> letâ€™s call
that <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. The complement
operator deals with the other half</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{P} =  \left(
\frac{1}{2^{2N-1}} \sum_{\Lambda} \prod_{i\in\{i\}} D_i\right)
\left(\frac{1 + \prod_i^{2N} D_i}{2}\right) = \mathcal{S} \cdot
\mathcal{P}_0\]</span></p>
<p>To compute <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0\)</span> the
main quantity needed is the product of the local projectors <span
class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\prod_i^{2N} D_i = \prod_i^{2N} b^x_i b^y_i b^z_i
c_i \]</span> for a toroidal trivalent lattice with <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(2N\)</span> vertices and <span
class="math inline">\(3N\)</span> edges.</p>
<p>First we reorder the operators by bond type, this doesnâ€™t require any
information about the underlying lattice.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\prod_i^{2N} D_i = \prod_i^{2N} b^x_i
\prod_i^{2N} b^y_i \prod_i^{2N} b^z_i \prod_i^{2N} c_i\]</span></p>
<p>The product over <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators
reduces to a determinant of the Q matrix and the fermion parity,
see<span class="citation"
data-cites="pedrocchiPhysicalSolutionsKitaev2011b"><sup><a
href="#ref-pedrocchiPhysicalSolutionsKitaev2011b"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> . The only difference from the
honeycomb case is that we cannot explicitely compute the factors <span
class="math inline">\(p_x,p_y,p_z = \pm\;1\)</span> that arise from
reordering the b operators such that pairs of vertices linked by the
corresponding bonds are adjacent.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\prod_i^{2N} b^\alpha_i = p_\alpha
\prod_{(i,j)}b^\alpha_i b^\alpha_j\]</span></p>
<p>However they are simply the parity of the permutation from one
ordering to the other and can be computed in linear time with a cycle
decomposition<span class="citation"
data-cites="app:cycle_decomp"><sup><a href="#ref-app:cycle_decomp"
role="doc-biblioref"><strong>app:cycle_decomp?</strong></a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>We find that <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}_0 = 1 +
p_x\;p_y\;p_z\; \mathrm{det}(Q^u) \; \hat{\pi} \; \prod_{\{i,j\}}
-iu_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p_x\;p_y\;p_z = \pm 1\)</span> are
lattice structure factors. <span class="math inline">\(Q^u\)</span> is
the determinant of the matrix mentioned earlier that maps <span
class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> operators to normal mode operators
<span class="math inline">\(b&#39;_i, b&#39;&#39;_i\)</span>. These
depend only on the lattice structure. <span class="math inline">\(\prod
-i \; u_{ij}\)</span> depend on the lattice and the particular vortex
sector. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi} = \prod{i}^{N} (1 -
2\hat{n}_i)\)</span> is the parity of the particular many body state
determined by fermionic occupation numbers <span
class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>All these factors take values <span class="math inline">\(\pm
1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0\)</span> is 0 or
1 for a particular state. Since <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> corresponds to symmetrising
over all the gauge configurations and cannot be 0, this tells use that
once we have determined the single particle eigenstates of a bond
sector, the true many body ground state has the same energy as either
the empty state with <span class="math inline">\(n_i = 0\)</span> or a
state with a single fermion in the lowest level.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s think about where are with the model now. We can map the spin
Hamiltonian to a Majorana Hamiltonian in an extended Hilbert space.
Along with that mapping comes a gauge field <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> defining <strong>bond
sectors</strong>. The gauge symmetries of <span
class="math inline">\(u_{jk}\)</span> are generated by the set of <span
class="math inline">\(D_j\)</span> operators. The gauge invariant and
therefore physically relevant variables are the plaquette operators
<span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> which define as a
<strong>vortex sector</strong>. In order to practically solve the
Majorana Hamiltonian we must remove hats from the gauge field by
restricting ourselves to a particular bond sector. From there the
Majorana Hamiltonian becomes non-interacting and we can solve it like
any quadratic theory. This lets us construct the single particle
eigenstates from which we can also construct many body states. However
the many body states constructed this way are not in the physical
subspace!</p>
<p>However for the many body states within a particular bond sector,
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_0 = 0,1\)</span> tells us which
of those have some overlap with the physical sector.</p>
<p>We see that finding a state that has overlap with a physical state
only ever requires the addition or removal of one fermion. There are
cases where this can make a difference but for most observables such as
ground state energy this correction scales away as the number of
fermions in the system grows.</p>
<p>If we wanted to construct a full many body wavefunction in the spin
basis we would need to include the full symmetrisation over the gauge
fields. However this was not necessary for any of the results that will
be presented here.</p>
<h2 id="open-boundary-conditions">Open boundary conditions</h2>
<p>Care must be taken in the definition of open boundary conditions.
Simply removing bonds from the lattice leaves behind unpaired <span
class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators that need to be paired
in some way to arrive at fermionic modes. In order to fix a pairing we
always start from a lattice defined on the torus and generate a lattice
with open boundary conditions by defining the bond coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^{\alpha}_{ij} = 0\)</span> for sites joined by
bonds <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> that we want to remove.
This creates fermionic zero modes <span
class="math inline">\(u_{ij}\)</span> associated with these cut bonds
which we set to 1 when calculating the projector.</p>
<p>Alternatively, since all the fermionic zero modes are degenerate
anyway, an arbitrary pairing of the unpaired <span
class="math inline">\(b^\alpha\)</span> operators could be performed.
<strong>Is is possible that a lattice constructed and coloured like this
would have unequal numbers of <span class="math inline">\(b^x\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(b^y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b^z\)</span> operators?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-ground-state-vortex-sector">The Ground State Vortex
Sector</h2>
<p>On the Honeycomb, Liebâ€™s theorem implies that the the ground state
corresponds to the state where all <span class="math inline">\(u_jk =
1\)</span> implying that the flux free sector is the ground state
sector<span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"><sup><a
href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Liebâ€™s theorem does not generalise easily to the amorphous case.
However we can get some intuition by examining the problem that will
lead to a guess for the ground state. We will then provide numerical
evidence that this guess is in fact correct.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s consider the partition function of the Majorana hamiltonian:
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = \mathrm{Tr}\left( e^{-\beta
H}\right) = \sum_i \exp{-\beta \epsilon_i}\]</span> At low temperatures
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z} \approx \beta
\epsilon_0\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is the lowest energy fermionic
state.</p>
<p>How does the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Z}\)</span> depend
on the Majorana hamiltonian? Expanding the exponential out gives: <span
class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = \sum_n \frac{(-\beta)^n}{n!}
\mathrm{Tr(H^k)} \]</span></p>
<p>Now thereâ€™s an interesting observation to make here. The Hamiltonian
is essentially a scaled adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix being a
matrix <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(g_{ij} = 1\)</span> if vertices <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and joined by an edge and 0
otherwise.</p>
<p>Powers of adjacency matrices have the property that the entry <span
class="math inline">\((g^n)_{ij}\)</span> corresponds to the number of
paths of length n on the graph that begin at site <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and end at site <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. These include somewhat degenerate
paths that go back on themselves etc.</p>
<p>The trace of an adjacency matrix <span
class="math display">\[\mathrm{Tr}(g^n) = \sum_i (g^n)_{ii}\]</span>
therefore counts the number number of loops of size <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that can be drawn on the graph.</p>
<p>Applying the same treatment to our Majorana Hamiltonian, we can
interpret <span class="math inline">\(u_ij\)</span> to equal 0 if the
two sites are not joined by a bond and we put ourselves in the isotropic
phase where <span class="math inline">\(J^\alpha = 1\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_{ij} =  \tfrac{1}{2} i
u_{ij}\]</span></p>
<p>We then see that the trace of the nth power of H is a sums over
Wilson loops of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with an
additional factor of <span class="math inline">\(2^{-n}\)</span>. We
showed earlier that the Wilson loop operators can always be written as
products of the plaquette operators that they enclose.</p>
<p>Lumping all the prefactors together, we can write: <span
class="math display">\[ \mathcal{Z} = c_A \hat{A} + c_B \hat{B} + \sum_i
c_i \hat{\phi}_i + \sum_{ij} c_{ij}  \hat{\phi}_i \hat{\phi}_j +
\sum_{ijk} c_{ijk}  \hat{\phi}_i \hat{\phi}_j \hat{\phi}_k +
...\]</span></p>
<p>Where the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> factors would be
something like <span class="math display">\[c_{ijk...} = \sum_n
\tfrac{(-\beta)^n}{n!} \tfrac{1}{2^n} K_{ijk...}\]</span> which is a sum
over all loop lengths <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and for
each we have a combinatoral factor <span
class="math inline">\(K_{ijk...}\)</span> that counts how many ways
there are to draw a loop of length <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that only encloses plaquettes <span
class="math inline">\(ijk...\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also have the pesky non-contractible loop operators <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{A}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{B}\)</span>. Again the prefactors for these
are very complicated but we can intuitively see that for larger and
larger loops lengths there will be a combinatorial explosion of possible
ways that they appear in these sums. These are suppressed exponentially
with system size but at practical lattice sizes they cause significant
finite size effects. The main evidence of this is that the 4 loop
sectors spanned by the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{A}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{B}\)</span> operators are degenerate in
the infinite system size limit, while that degeneracy is lifted in
finite sized systems.</p>
<p>We donâ€™t have much hope of actually evaluating this for an amorphous
lattice. However it lead us to guess that the ground state vortex sector
might be a simple function of the side length of each plaquette.</p>
<p>The ground state of the Amorphous Kitaev Model is found by setting
the flux through each plaquette <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> to be equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\phi^{\mathrm{g.s.}}(n_{\mathrm{sides}})\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \phi^{\mathrm{g.s.}}(n_{\mathrm{sides}}) = -(\pm
i)^{n_{\mathrm{sides}}},
\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n_{\mathrm{sides}}\)</span> is the number of edges
that form each plaquette and the choice of sign gives a twofold chiral
ground state degeneracy.</p>
<p>This conjecture is consistent with Liebâ€™s theorem on regular
lattices<span class="citation" data-cites="lieb_flux_1994"><sup><a
href="#ref-lieb_flux_1994" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span> and
is supported by numerical evidence. As noted before, any flux that
differs from the ground state is an excitation which I call a
vortex.</p>
<h3 id="finite-size-effects">Finite size effects</h3>
<p>This guess only works for larger lattices because of the finite size
effects. In order to rigorously test it we would like to directly
enumerate the <span class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> vortex sectors
for a smaller lattice and check that the lowest state found is the
vortex sector predicted by ???.</p>
<p>To do this we tile an amorphous lattice onto a repeating <span
class="math inline">\(NxN\)</span> grid. The use of a fourier series
then allows us to compute the diagonalisation with a penalty only linear
in the number of tiles used compared to diagonalising a single lattice.
With this technique the finite size effects related to the
non-contractible loop operators are removed with only a linear penalty
in computation time compared to the exponential penalty paid by simply
simply diagonalising larger lattices.</p>
<p>Using this technique we verified that <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_0\)</span> correctly predicts the ground
state for hundreds of thousands of lattices with upto 20 plaquettes. For
larger lattices we verified that random perturbations around the
predicted ground state never yield a lower energy state.</p>
<h2 id="chiral-symmetry">Chiral Symmetry</h2>
<p>In the discussion above we see that the ground state has a twofold
<strong>chiral</strong> degeneracy that comes about because the global
sign of the odd plaquettes does not matter.</p>
<p>This happens because by adding odd plaquettes we have broken the time
reversal symmetry of the original model<span class="citation"

<p>Most thermodynamic and quantum phases studied can be characterised by
a local order parameter. That is, a function or operator that only
requires knowledge about some fixed sized patch of the system that does
not scale with system size.</p>
<p>However there are quantum phases that cannot be characterised by such
a local order parameter. These phases are intead said to posess
â€˜topological orderâ€™.</p>
<p>One property of topological order that is particularly easy to
observe that the ground state degeneracy depends on the topology of the
manifold that we put the system on to. This is referred to as
topological degeneracy to distinguish it from standard symmetry
breaking.</p>
<p>The Kitaev model will be a good example of this, we have already
looked at it defined on a graph that is embedded either into the plane
or onto the torus. The extension to surfaces like the torus but with
more than one handle is relatively easy.</p>
<h2 id="anyonic-statistics">Anyonic Statistics</h2>
<p>In dimensions greater than two, the quantum state of a system must
pick up a factor of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> if two identical particles are
swapped. We call these Fermions and Bosons.</p>
<p>This argument is predicated on the idea that performing two swaps is
equivalent to doing nothing. Doing nothing should not change the quantum
state at all, so doing one swap can at most multiply it by <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>However there are many hidden parts to this argument. Firstly, this
argument just isnâ€™t the whole story, if you want to know why Fermions
have half integer spin, for instance, you have to go to field
theory.</p>
<p>There is also a second niggle, why does this argument only work in
dimensions greater than two? What weâ€™re really saying when we say that
two swaps do nothing is that the world lines of two particles that have
been swapped twice can be untangled without crossing. Why canâ€™t they
cross? Well because if they cross then the particles can interact and
the quantum state could change in an arbitrary way. Weâ€™re implcitly
using the locality of physics here to argue that if the worldlines stay
well separated then the overall quantum state cannot too much.</p>
<p>In two dimensions we cannot untangle the worldlines of two particles
that have swapped places, they are braided together. See fig.Â <a

<p>From this fact flows a whole new world of behaviours, now the quantum
state can aquire a phase factor <span
class="math inline">\(e^{i\phi}\)</span> upon exchange of two identical
particles, which we now call Anyons.</p>
<p>The Kitaev Model is a good demonstration of the connection beween
Anyons and topological degeneracy. In the Kitaev model we can create a
pair of vortices, move one around a non-contractable loop <span

together. Without topology this should leave the quantum state
unchanged. Instead it moves us to another ground state in a
topologically degenerate ground state subspace. Practically speaking it

<p>If the ground state subspace is multidimensional, quasiparticle
exchange can move us around in the space with an action corresponding to
a matrix. These matrices do not in general commmute and so these are
known as non-Abelian anyons.</p>
<p>From here things get even more complex, the Kitaev model has a
non-Abelian phase when exposed to a magnetic field, and the amorphous
Kitaev Model has a non-Abelian phase because of its broken chiral
symmetry.</p>
<p>The way that we have subdivided the Kitaev model into vortex sectors,
we have a neat separation beween vortices and fermionic excitations.
However if we looked at the full many body picture we would see that a
vortex caries with it a cloud of bound majorana states.</p>

this to get from the <span class="math inline">\((\Phi_x, \Phi_y) = (+1,

<p>However in the non-Abelian phase we have to wrangle with
monodromy<span class="citation"
data-cites="chungExplicitMonodromyMoore2007 oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007"><sup><a

role="doc-biblioref">18</a>,<a
href="#ref-oshikawaTopologicalDegeneracyNonAbelian2007"
role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span>. Monodromy is behaviour of
objects as they move around a singularity. This manifests here in that
the identity of a vortex and cloud of Majoranas can change as we wind
them around the torus in such a way that rather than anhilating to the
vacuum the anhilate to create an excited state instead of a ground
state. This means we end up with only three degenerate ground states in
the non-Abelian phase <span class="math inline">\((+1, +1), (+1, -1),
(-1, +1)\)</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010"><sup><a
href="#ref-chungTopologicalQuantumPhase2010"
role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span>. The way that this shows up
concretly is that the projector enforces both flux and fermion parity.
When we wind a vortex around both non-contractible loops of the torus,
it flips the flux parity which forces means we have to introduce a
fermionic excitation to make the state physical. Hence the process does
not give a fourth ground state.</p>

alt="(Bond Sector) A state in the bond sector is specified by assigning \pm 1 to each edge of the lattice. However this description has a substantial gauge degeneracy. We can simplfy things by decomposing each state into the product of three kinds of objects: (Vortex Sector) Only a small number of bonds need to be flipped (compared to some arbitrary reference) to reconstruct the vortex sector. The edges here are chosen from a spanning tree of the dual lattice, so there are no loops. (Gauge Field) The â€˜loopinessâ€™ of the bond sector can be factored out giving a network of loops that can always be written as a product the of the gauge operators D_j. (Topolical Sector) Finally there are two loops that have no effect on the vortex sector, nor can they be constructed from gauge symmetries. These can be thought of as two fluxes \Phi_{x/y} that thread through the major and minor axes of the torus. Measuring \Phi_{x/y} corresponds to constructing Wilson loops around the axes of the torus. We can flip the value of \Phi_{x} by transporting a vortex pair around the torus in the y direction and that is what is shown here. In each of the three figures on the right, black bonds correspond to those that must be flipped, composing the three together gives back the original bond sector on the left." /></p>
<p>One reason the topology has gained interest recently is there have
proposals to use this ground state degeneracy to implement both
passively fault tolerant and actively stabilised quantum computations
