## 2017, CMS HGCAL Sensor Characterisation, CERN

I worked at CERN for 3 months as a summer student, helping to design a high volume electronic measurement processfor prototypes of 8 inch silicon sensors that will be used in a planned upgrade to the CMS endcap Calorimeter for the new High Luminsosity LHC upgrade. My time was split between working in a clean room on the measurement setup, analysing the data and attending a 6 week lecture course on High Energy Physics.
