Here's a quick one, using the aforementioned massive lasercutter at my makerspace, I made this little pot stand out of lasercut ply.

And here's a quick fit test. When doing joints like this you need to compensate for the kerf of the laser (maybe kerf isn't the right word but you know what I mean). I found about 0.1mm kerf compensation worked well for this laser with 6mm ply.

I still need to sand it and glue it together but it's looking pretty cool! I might try to find a clear lacquer to preserve that lovely blackened edge.
