This is a page about building an [OpenFlexure Microscope v7](https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/build). I got the parts as a kit from [Lab Crafter](https://labcrafter.co.uk/products/openflexure-microscope)

## Printing

<figure class="two-wide">
<img src="{{page.assets}}/printing.jpeg" alt = "A quick snap of a 3D printer (heavily modified ender 3) thatâ€™s about 12 hours into a 2 day print. The print itself is particularly complex, it looks like some kind of fancy high rise building. Multi coloured wires and zip ties emerge from the hotend. A blue aura comes of the screen to the right. ">
<img src="{{page.assets}}/plate1.jpg" alt = "A photo of a magnetic 3D printer plate, removed from the bed. On top is a plate of complicated looking parts in a dark brown/reddish colour. Three gears are recognisable in the front.">
