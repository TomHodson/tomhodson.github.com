There's something fascinating about maps. I particularly love how they have this kind of fractal level of detail as you zoom in and out. Look at this one, I really like the minimalist black and white design.

These map tiles are from <a href="https://stamen.com/">Stamen design</a>, essentially a really nice style sheet on top of &copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributor data. The viewer is <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet.js</a>. I used CSS container queries to make this a nice square shape.

In related news, my excellent [co-working space / carpentry workshop / pottery studio](https://www.r-a-r-a.com/) currently has a massive laser cutter which we may or may not keep for the long term.

The laser cutter can do either a raster or vector. Here is a raster into some birch plywood. They're 10cm square with slightly different settings.

Given the laser cutter is so massive I thought it might be fun to try to produce a huge map. There's a spot at the top of the stairs in our flat that I think could be nice for it. My partner and I have always always lived somewhere in this vertical strip of london so the tall thin shape has some significance.

A blender render of what it might look like based on a 3D scan of my flat. This took all my very rudimentary new blender skills to put together.
