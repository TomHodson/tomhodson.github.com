I made my first PCB!

I've had a longstanding ambition to get a PCB manufacured but I've always put it off. Lately I had a need for a little adapter board to break out these 1.27mm spaced pins to 2.54mm pins that would fit into a breadboard. Feeling like it was a simple enough board I finally decided to fire up KiCad and give it a go.
