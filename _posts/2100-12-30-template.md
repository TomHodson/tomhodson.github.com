The first big project of the year was repainting this ladder up to our mezzanine bed. This ended up being so much more work than we expected, they say it's all in the surface prep and the surface prep here took ages with all the awkward corners. 

There was one aspect that was fun with this which was that I made non-slip pads on the rungs by mixing the gloss paint with sand and painting over masked rectangle.
