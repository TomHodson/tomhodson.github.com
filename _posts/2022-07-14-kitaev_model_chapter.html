<p>Here is a footnote reference,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and another.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>This paragraph won’t be part of the note, because it isn’t
indented.</p>
<h2 id="the-kitaev-honeycomb-model">The Kitaev Honeycomb Model</h2>
<p>The Kitaev-Honeycomb model is remarkable because it was the first
such model that combined three key properties.</p>
<p>First, it is a plausible tight binding Hamiltonian. The form of the
Hamiltonian could be realised by a real material. Indeed candidate
materials such as were quickly found that are expected to behave
according to the Kitaev with small corrections.</p>
<p>Second, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is deeply interesting to modern
condensed matter theory. Its ground state is almost the canonical
example of the long sought after quantum spin liquid state. Its
excitations are anyons, particles that can only exist in two dimensions
that break the normal fermion/boson dichotomy. Anyons have been the
subject of much attention because, among other reasons, there are
proposals to braid them through space and time to achieve noise tolerant
quantum computations .</p>
<p>Third and perhaps most importantly, it a rare many body interacting
quantum system that can be treated analytically. It is exactly solveable
meaning that we can explicitly write down its many body ground states in
terms of single particle states~. Its solubility comes about because the
model has extensively many conserved degrees of freedom that mediate the
interactions between quantum degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>To get down to brass tacks, the Kitaev Honeycomb model is a model of
interacting spin<span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span>s on the
vertices of a honeycomb lattice. Each bond in the lattice is assigned a
label <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \{ x, y, z\}\)</span> and
that bond couples its two spin neighbours along the <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>This gives us the Hamiltonian <span
class="math display">\[\mathcal{H} =  - \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle_\alpha}
J^{\alpha}\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha},\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^\alpha_j\)</span> is a Pauli matrix acting
on site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, (j,k_) is a pair of
nearest-neighbour indices connected by an <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-bond with exchange coupling <span
class="math inline">\(J^\alpha\)</span>~.</p>
<p>% plaquette operators and wilson loops This model has a set of
conserved quantities that, in the spin language, take the form of Wilson
loops <span class="math display">\[W_p = \prod
\sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha}\]</span> following any closed path of
the lattice. In this product each pair of spins appears twice with two
of the three bonds types, using the spin commutation relations we can
replace each pair with the third. For a single hexagonal plaquette this
looks like: <span class="math display">\[W_p = \sigma_1^{z}\sigma_2^{z}
\sigma_2^{x}\sigma_3^{x} \sigma_3^{y}\sigma_4^{y}
\sigma_4^{z}\sigma_5^{z} \sigma_5^{x}\sigma_6^{x}
\sigma_6^{y}\sigma_1^{y}\]</span> $<span class="math inline">\(W_p =
\sigma_1^{x}\sigma_2^{y} \sigma_3^{z} \sigma_4^{x}
\sigma_5^{y}\sigma_6^{z}\)</span> In this latter form can be seen to
commute with all the terms in the Hamiltonian because { why again?}</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian commutes with the plaquette operators <span
class="math inline">\(W_p\)</span>, products of the <span
class="math inline">\(K\)</span>s around a plaquette. The Ks also
commute with one another. <span class="math display">\[W_p =
\prod_{&lt;ij&gt; \in P} K_{ij} = K_{12}K_{23}K_{34}K_{56} ...
K_{N1}\]</span></p>
<p>Expanding the bond operators <span class="math inline">\(K_{ij} =
\sigma_i^{\alpha} \sigma_j^{\alpha}\)</span>, Pauli operators on each
site appear in adjacent pairs so can be replaced via <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_i \sigma_j = \delta_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}
\sigma_k\)</span> giving a product of Pauli matrices associated with the
outward pointing bonds from the plaquette. In the general case: <span
class="math display">\[W_p = \prod_{i \in P} i (-1)^{c_i}
\sigma_i\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_i = 0,1\)</span>
measures the handedness of the edges around vertex i, see Fig <span
class="math inline">\(\ref{fig:handedness}\)</span>. Plaquette operators
for plaquettes with even numbers of edges square to 1 and hence have
eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>, while those
around odd plaquettes have eigenvalues (i) breaking chiral symmetry. The
values of the plaquette operators partition the Hilbert space of the
Hamiltonian into a set of flux sectors.</p>
<p>% relationship between wilson loops and topology Such paths can
enclose a collection of faces or `plaquettes’ of the lattice. In the
case of periodic boundary conditions, the system is torioidal and we
also get Wilson loops that wind the whole system without enclosing a
definite area. The loop operator associated with each such path has
eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(/pm 1\)</span> and can be
interpreted as measuring the magnetic flux through that region. Without
going into the details of counting them, the number of these conserved
loop operators clearly scales with system size and it is this extensive
number of classical degrees of freedom that ultimately allows us to
decouple this interacting many body hamiltonian into a set of non
interaction quadratic hamiltonians. { add a figure showing the different
kinds of Wilson loops and of an example plaquette}</p>

</div>
<p>In order to actually solve the model we need to figure out how to
leverage these conserved quantities. The trick is not so much a trick as
an almost perfect consequence of the structure of the model and perhaps
this was in fact how Kitaev first came up with it. We know that a single
spin<span class="math inline">\(-1/2\)</span> can be represented by
fermionic creation and annihilation operators <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^{\pm} = 1/2(\sigma^x \pm \sigma^y)\)</span>
through a Jordan-Wigner transformation~, this gives one fermion for each
spin. In turn a fermion can be broken into two Majorana fermions <span
class="math inline">\(c_1 = 1/\sqrt{1}(f + f^\dagger)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c_2 = i/\sqrt{1}(f - f^\dagger)\)</span>. If we
double up the Hilbert space we get four Majoranas per spin:</p>
