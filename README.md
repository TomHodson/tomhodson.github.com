Generates my personal website. I copied (rather than forked to preserve previous history of this repo) the template is from https://academicpages.github.io/ which is a Github Pages template for academic websites released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

## Installing Ruby
You probably want to run ruby from a version manager like `chruby`, see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

## Todo
  - add humans.txt https://humanstxt.org/

Use `bundle exec jekyll serve --draft --future` to do local development of this site
