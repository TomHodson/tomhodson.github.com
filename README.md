Generates my personal website. I copied (rather than forked to preserve previous history of this repo) the template is from https://academicpages.github.io/ which is a Github Pages template for academic websites released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

## Todo
  - add CMTH talks
  - fix the OG tags so that https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator works
  - figure out how to integrate a jupyter notebook

## Notes
Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to do local development of this site
