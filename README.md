## Installing Ruby
You probably want to run ruby from a version manager like `chruby`, see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

## Todo
  - add humans.txt https://humanstxt.org/
  - fix the OG tags so that https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator works
  - consider switching to using pandoc as a markdown renderer
  - setup webmentions https://aarongustafson.github.io/jekyll-webmention_io/
  - add a theme toggle button: https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/best-light-dark-mode-theme-toggle-javascript/
  - make sure the above works with the thesis section, will probably require stripping the html tag.

## Validators
  - [blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight)

## Notes
[Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)
