Collective Behaviours are what you get when a big collection of things interact with one another. Think of a flock of starlings or a mexican wave in a stadium. Now when you make the things quantum too, _really_ interesting things happen...

My research focuses on the behaviour of electrons in crystaline solids.<br>

<!-- I study a simplified models of electrons moving about in a crystal. A crystal is a structure that repeats through space, like the pattern on a chess board. We work in one dimension so in our case it would be more like patterns of coloured beads on a necklace. In addition the crystal is slightly disordered, as if the person making the necklace sometimes gets it a little wrong. This disorder tends to disrupt the movement of the electrons, often meaning that they cannot move at all.  -->
