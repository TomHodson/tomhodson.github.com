Generates my personal website.

## Installing Ruby
You probably want to run ruby from a version manager like `chruby`, see [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

## Todo
  - add humans.txt https://humanstxt.org/
  - fix the OG tags so that https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator works
  - consider switching to using pandoc as a markdown renderer
  - switch so that the blog is served from the root instead of doing a redirect
  - setup webmentions https://aarongustafson.github.io/jekyll-webmention_io/

## Notes
[Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)

Then
Use `./run.sh` to do local development of this site
